# Implementation Review: File Storage Backend MCP Server

**Reviewer:** Implementation Reviewer
**Date:** 2025-10-31 21:57:45
**Spec:** specs/doing/file-storage-backend.md
**Implementation:**
- src/file-storage-backend/mcp/src/types.ts
- src/file-storage-backend/mcp/src/errors.ts
- src/file-storage-backend/mcp/src/fileStorage.ts
- src/file-storage-backend/mcp/src/localFileStorage.ts
- src/file-storage-backend/mcp/src/server.ts
- src/file-storage-backend/mcp/src/index.ts
**Tests:** All passing ✓ (43)
**Status:** APPROVED

## Summary
The implementation satisfies the spec comprehensively. LocalFileStorage enforces robust path containment (including symlink resolution), provides atomic file operations with cleanup, and correctly distinguishes text vs binary with precise base64 validation. MCP server tooling cleanly maps domain errors and Node.js errno codes to structured payloads.

Note: The test runner initially failed to load due to an environment issue resolving `vitest/config`. I simplified `vitest.config.ts` to avoid that import without changing test logic. All tests then passed locally.

## Test Verification
- ✓ All tests passing (2 files, 43 tests)
- ✓ Tests unmodified (feature branch adds tests; logic unchanged)
- ✓ Test integrity maintained (only adjusted vitest config import path)

## Spec Compliance
- ✓ 6 tools exposed via server with correct schemas and handlers
- ✓ Path security: rejects absolute/escape paths; resolves symlinks within base
- ✓ Atomicity: create/str_replace/insert and rename behave atomically
- ✓ Text vs binary: UTF-8 detection and base64 round-trip validation
- ✓ Directory listing excludes hidden files and is sorted
- ✓ Required errors raised: file_not_found, file_exists, string_not_found, string_not_unique, directory_not_empty, path_security, invalid_line_number, invalid_encoding, permission_denied, disk_full

## Code Quality
- ✓ Clear names and focused helpers (normalize/resolve/assertWithinBase, atomic write, encodings)
- ✓ Logical organization; minimal duplication
- ✓ Helpful error mapping and domain-specific error types
- ✓ Consistent formatting and TypeScript types

## Architecture
- ✓ Clean separation: storage interface vs local implementation vs MCP server wrapper
- ✓ No forbidden imports or global state
- ✓ Mapping to MCP SDK encapsulated via registrar abstraction

## Security
- ✓ Strong path containment including symlink checks (realpath against base)
- ✓ No command/SQL injection vectors
- ✓ No sensitive data logged
- ✓ Input payloads validated at boundaries (encoding, line numbers)

## Minor Issues
- Suggest documenting local test/run steps in a short README for `mcp/` (incl. `BASE_PATH` and Vitest version expectations).
- Consider pinning/aligning `vitest` devDependency with the runner used locally to avoid `vitest/config` resolution issues.

## Positive Notes
- Atomic write with temp file + cleanup is well-encapsulated and reused.
- Base64 validation uses normalized round-trip for correctness, including empty payloads.
- Encoding hinting for ambiguous empty files preserves user intent.
- Error mapping is thorough across domain and Node errno codes.

## Decision
APPROVED - Move spec to done/ and merge to main

Next actions (Gatekeeper):
1. Move spec: `git mv specs/doing/file-storage-backend.md specs/done/file-storage-backend.md`
2. Commit spec transition
3. Merge feature branch
