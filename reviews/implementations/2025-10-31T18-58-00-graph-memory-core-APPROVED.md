**Status:** APPROVED

## Summary
The implementation fully satisfies the spec: 18 MCP tools are implemented with ontology-driven validation, registry persistence, cascade delete, property filtering (AND), traversal, and case-insensitive content search excluding binary content. Tests (unit, integration, stdio e2e) are comprehensive and GREEN. Architecture is clean with a storage gateway abstraction and no global state. Error handling is precise with spec-aligned error codes and messages.

## Test Verification
- ✓ All tests passing (34 tests across unit, integration, e2e)
  - Package: src/graph-memory-core/mcp (vitest)
- ✓ Tests unmodified to weaken assertions (authoritative in this feature branch)
- ✓ Test integrity maintained; coverage exercises acceptance criteria and edge cases

## Spec Compliance
- ✓ AC1 Node lifecycle (create/get/meta/content, persistence)
- ✓ AC2 Connection lifecycle (create/get, persistence)
- ✓ AC3 Queries (nodes by type+properties AND; connections by from/to/type; traversal)
- ✓ AC4 Ontology validation (create_ontology; INVALID_NODE_TYPE; INVALID_TOPOLOGY; validate_connection)
- ✓ AC5 Cascade delete (node delete removes connected connections, preserves target nodes)
- ✓ AC6 Node errors (NODE_NOT_FOUND on get/update/delete)
- ✓ AC7 Connection errors (INVALID_CONNECTION_TYPE; NODE_NOT_FOUND; CONNECTION_NOT_FOUND)
- ✓ AC8 Ontology violations include allowed targets in message
- ✓ AC9 Required properties enforced for connections
- ✓ AC10 Ontology protection (already exists; append-only add type)
- ✓ AC11 Registry consistency (atomic writes; rollback on failure)
- ✓ AC12 Empty/minimal data (empty content/properties; unfiltered queries)
- ✓ AC13 Isolated nodes valid; traversal empty; deletion works
- ✓ AC14 Multiple connections and independence on deletion
- ✓ AC15 Property filtering AND semantics (empty filter matches all of type)
- ✓ AC16 Content search (case-insensitive; node_type filter; limit; empty results; ignores binary)
- ✓ AC17 Append-only ontology updates reflected in get_ontology
- ✓ AC18 Direction handling (out/in/both)
- ✓ AC19 Atomic operations (no partial files/registry on failure; delete cleans up content)
- ✓ AC20 Registry persistence across restart

## Code Quality
- ✓ Clear names and focused functions
- ✓ Logical organization (domain services, gateway, server adapter)
- ✓ No duplication of business logic; helpers for persistence/cleanup
- ✓ Consistent formatting and helpful docstrings

## Architecture
- ✓ Follows GUIDELINES and clean layering (domain + storage gateway + transport)
- ✓ DI via GraphStorageGateway; no hard-coded FS paths beyond constants
- ✓ No global state; state encapsulated in Registry/Ontology/MemoryGraph
- ✓ File paths normalized and contained under base path

## Security
- ✓ No injection vectors (no SQL/command execution)
- ✓ Path containment enforced (resolve + prefix check)
- ✓ No secrets logged or stored in code

## Minor Issues
- types.ts header references `specs/todo/graph-memory-core.md`; current path is `specs/done/graph-memory-core.md` after approval. Non-blocking.
- storageGateway.ts encode/decode comments still mention “NotImplementedError” in JSDoc, but functions are implemented. Nit only.

## Positive Notes
- Robust error types with detailed messages that include allowed from/to types for topology errors.
- Thoughtful atomicity and rollback handling in create/update/delete flows.
- e2e stdio test compiles TS and exercises real process wiring.

## Decision
APPROVED - Move spec to done/ and proceed to merge.

Next steps:
1. Move spec: `git mv specs/doing/graph-memory-core.md specs/done/graph-memory-core.md`
2. Commit transition and merge feature branch to main
