**Status:** APPROVED

## Summary
All previously flagged gaps are addressed. The suite now covers AC1–AC20 with clear, behavior-first tests, proper isolation, and helpful headers. RED phase is intact via NotImplementedError stubs. Tests are ready to drive implementation (GREEN phase).

## Clarity & Readability
- ✓ Descriptive names with AC references
- ✓ Clear Arrange–Act–Assert structure
- ✓ Meaningful variables and self-contained fixtures

## Completeness
- ✓ Happy paths (nodes, connections, queries, traversal, search)
- ✓ Error cases (invalid types, invalid topology, missing endpoints, non-existent IDs)
- ✓ Edge cases (empty/minimal data, isolated nodes, multiple connections)
- ✓ Ontology protection and append-only (AC10, AC17)
- ✓ Property filtering AND semantics (AC15)
- ✓ Content search, including no-matches and binary exclusion (AC16)
- ✓ Persistence across restart for nodes and connections (AC20)
- ✓ Cascade delete and atomicity (AC5, AC19)
- ✓ Registry consistency after failures (AC11)

## Coverage Metrics
- Conceptual coverage is strong. Numeric line/branch coverage to be verified post-implementation; e2e transport test is present and skips if SDK unavailable.

## Independence
- ✓ No shared mutable state; FakeStorage per test
- ✓ Order-independent and fast

## RED Phase Verification
- ✓ Core methods still throw NotImplementedError; tests should fail for the correct reason until GREEN work begins.

## Positive Notes
- AC8 message includes allowed target types (regex assertion added).
- Deletion atomicity checks ensure no orphaned content files.
- Duplicate import in node lifecycle tests removed.

## Decision

APPROVED — Proceed to implementation (GREEN phase).
