# Test Review: File Storage Backend MCP (TypeScript)

**Reviewer:** Test Reviewer
**Date:** 2025-10-30 18:45:00
**Spec:** specs/doing/file-storage-backend.md
**Test Files:**
- src/file-storage-backend/mcp/tests/localFileStorage.test.ts
- src/file-storage-backend/mcp/tests/fileStorageMcpServer.test.ts
**Status:** APPROVED

## Summary
The TypeScript test suite is clear, behavior-focused, and comprehensive for both the LocalFileStorage implementation and the MCP server layer. It covers happy paths, edge cases, error mapping, path security (including relative and symlink escapes), atomicity guarantees via simulated rename failures, directory listing semantics, encoding rules, and newly requested scenarios (trailing slash equivalence, empty files, delete with only hidden files, relative escape on create). The suite is suitable to gate the GREEN phase.

## Clarity & Readability
- ✓ Descriptive names (method_scenario_expected) across tests
- ✓ Clean AAA structure and minimal inline complexity
- ✓ Meaningful variables and helper utilities
- ✓ Self-contained tests using temp directories

## Completeness
- ✓ Happy paths: create/view, insert, str_replace, rename, delete
- ✓ Edge cases: trailing slash handling, path normalization, empty files, binary view/create
- ✓ Error cases: not found, exists, invalid line number, text ops on binary, non-unique/missing string, relative/absolute escapes
- ✓ MCP server error mapping: Node errno → MCP payload (file_not_found, file_exists, permission_denied, disk_full)
- ✓ Directory listing: sorted, dotfiles excluded
- ✓ Rename: parents auto-created; directory rename supported
- ✓ Atomicity: create/replace/insert/rename integrity verified via mocked fs.rename failures

## Coverage Metrics
- Target after implementation: ≥80% line, ≥70% branch for `src/file-storage-backend/mcp/src/**`.
- Consider enabling coverage in Vitest (e.g., `--coverage`) post-GREEN to verify targets.

## Independence
- ✓ Each test uses isolated temp base directory via fs.mkdtemp
- ✓ No shared mutable state; afterEach removes temp dirs
- ✓ Tests do not depend on execution order

## Behavior vs Implementation
- ✓ Tests assert observable behavior and contract semantics
- ✓ Atomicity tested via external effect (file state), not internals
- ✓ MCP layer tests validate tool registration and error-payload mapping, not internal server wiring

## Test Double Usage
- ✓ `vi.spyOn(fs, 'rename')` used narrowly to simulate failure; appropriate and restores after
- ✓ MCP server uses vi.fn mocks for the storage dependency; focused and minimal

## Assertions
- ✓ Specific assertions (content, encoding, size, entries ordering)
- ✓ Error types at storage layer; payload shape at MCP layer

## RED Phase
- Implementation stubs in `src/file-storage-backend/mcp/src/localFileStorage.ts` throw `NotImplementedError`, so tests should fail for the correct reason (RED). Attempted to run `npm test`; encountered a local Rollup/Vitest native module issue unrelated to test content. Given stubs, RED status is logically satisfied.
  - Note: Vitest startup error observed (Rollup optional dependency). Once environment permits, running tests should yield failures due to NotImplementedError.

## Positive Notes
- Good separation between storage contract tests and MCP tool-layer tests
- Trailing-slash parity, empty file handling, and relative-escape create case added as requested
- Clear error mapping coverage for common Node errno codes

## Decision
APPROVED – Test suite meets quality and completeness bar. Proceed to GREEN phase for the TypeScript implementation.
