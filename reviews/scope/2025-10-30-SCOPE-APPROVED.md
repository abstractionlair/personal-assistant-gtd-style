# Scope Review: Personal Assistant (GTD-Style)

**Reviewer**: Codex (Scope Reviewer)
**Date**: 2025-10-30
**Document**: SCOPE.md
**Version**: 1.0
**Status**: APPROVED

## Summary
The SCOPE.md is comprehensive, well-structured, and closely aligned with the VISION.md. It clearly defines an MVP focused on conversational GTD coaching backed by a two-layer memory architecture, with specific features, user capabilities, technical requirements, and measurable acceptance criteria. Boundaries are explicit (notably a strong stance against gamification), and constraints, assumptions, and risks are documented realistically for a solo developer using AI-assisted workflows.

Overall, the document is ready to hand off to the roadmap-writer. A few minor polish items are suggested to strengthen traceability to vision metrics and ensure minimality in acceptance criteria.

## Ontology Compliance
- ✓ All required sections present
- ✓ Sections in correct order
- ✓ Format matches ontology (risks include mitigations inline; separate “Mitigation Strategies” header optional)

## Completeness Check
- ✓ MVP features specific (6 items)
- ✓ Future phases defined (Phase 2, Phase 3+, Deferred)
- ✓ Out of scope explicit (7+ items with rationale)
- ✓ Success criteria measurable (6 primary criteria)
- ✓ All 4 constraint categories addressed (resource, technical, business, assumptions)
- ✓ Assumptions stated (5 items with risk/mitigation)

## Clarity Assessment
- ✓ Features concrete and specific (capability-level, not implementation details)
- ✓ No vague language in core sections; good examples throughout
- ✓ Examples provided where helpful (user capabilities, acceptance criteria)
- ✓ Technical terms used consistently (MCP, ontology, nodes/edges)

## Alignment Check
- ✓ Serves vision purpose (confident choices via persistent memory + coaching)
- ✓ Success criteria consistent with vision guardrails; consider mapping to vision metrics (minor)
- ✓ No contradictions; target users and timeline consistent with VISION.md

## Feasibility Assessment
- ✓ MVP scope appears achievable in 3–5 weeks with AI-assisted development and existing MCP components
- ✓ Constraints realistic (solo developer, 10–20 hrs/week)
- ✓ Success criteria attainable; risks noted with mitigations

## Critical Issues (if NEEDS-CHANGES)
None — no blockers identified.

## Minor Issues
1. Success Criteria mapping to Vision Metrics
   - Section: Success Criteria
   - Problem: Criteria validate MVP functionality but aren’t explicitly tied to VISION metrics (usage frequency, context continuity, decision confidence, WIP management).
   - Impact: Slightly weaker traceability from MVP “done” to vision outcomes.
   - Fix: Add a short note linking MVP validation week to early signals on those metrics (e.g., record redundant restatement rate; log check-in frequency).

2. Acceptance Criteria volume
   - Section: In Scope – MVP → Acceptance Criteria
   - Problem: 20+ checks exceed “typical 8–15” guidance; many are good but some could be grouped or labeled by priority.
   - Impact: Risk of over-scoping or diluting focus on minimum viable outcomes.
   - Fix: Optionally group into P0 (must-have) vs P1 (nice-to-have for MVP) to preserve minimality without deleting content.

3. Optional header parity with schema
   - Section: Risks and Mitigation
   - Problem: Mitigations are present inline per risk but there’s no separate “Mitigation Strategies” subheader.
   - Impact: Minor schema parity nit; no functional issue.
   - Fix: Consider adding a short “Mitigation Strategies” subsection or leave as-is (current structure is clear).

## Strengths
- Clear MVP capabilities and crisp boundaries (notably “Never in This Project” with strong rationale)
- Two-layer memory architecture well justified and scoped for MVP
- Specific, testable acceptance criteria and user capability statements
- Assumptions explicit with risks and mitigations
- Future phases logically extend MVP while keeping Phase 1 minimal

## Decision
APPROVED — ready for roadmap-writer.
