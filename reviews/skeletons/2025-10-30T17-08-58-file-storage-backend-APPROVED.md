# Skeleton Review: File Storage Backend MCP Server

**Reviewer:** Skeleton Reviewer (Codex)
**Date:** 2025-10-30 17:08:58
**Spec:** specs/todo/file-storage-backend.md
**Skeleton Files:**
- src/file-storage-backend/mcp/src/types.ts
- src/file-storage-backend/mcp/src/fileStorage.ts
- src/file-storage-backend/mcp/src/errors.ts
- src/file-storage-backend/mcp/src/localFileStorage.ts
- src/file-storage-backend/mcp/src/server.ts
- src/file-storage-backend/mcp/src/index.ts
**Status:** APPROVED

## Summary
All previously flagged contract mismatches are resolved. The FileStorage interface now mirrors the spec’s positional signatures and returns the spec-aligned FileContent union. Server layer stubs clearly indicate mapping from tool inputs to the updated interface. Skeleton remains hollow, fully typed, and test-ready.

## Contract Compliance
- ✓ All functions from spec present
- ✓ Signatures match spec exactly (positional args)
- ✓ Return type `FileContent` matches spec invariants
- ✓ Error codes and messages align with spec

## Testability Assessment
- ✓ Dependencies injectable (storage is abstract; server depends on interface)
- ✓ Interfaces abstract; no concrete deps hard-coded
- ✓ Clear separation of concerns (types, interface, implementation stub, server wiring)

## Completeness
- ✓ All methods have type annotations and JSDoc
- ✓ File/module headers present with spec link
- ✓ Discriminated union for `FileContent` encodes invariants
- ✓ Error hierarchy complete

## Hollowness Verification
- ✓ No business logic present
- ✓ All methods throw `NotImplementedError`
- ✓ No I/O performed in constructors

## Quality Checks
- Linter: Not run here (tooling not configured in repo root)
- Type checker: Not run here
- Imports valid and organized

## Minor Notes
- Keep server/index stubs unimplemented until tests (RED) are written; then implement in GREEN phase.
- Consider adding a minimal tsconfig and npm scripts in the MCP package later for CI checks.
- The Python storage skeleton appears outside the scope of this TypeScript MCP server; fine to leave as-is for a separate spec/feature.

## Decision
APPROVED — Ready for test-writer.

Next steps for skeleton-writer per workflow:
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/file-storage-backend`
2. Move spec to doing: `git mv specs/todo/file-storage-backend.md specs/doing/file-storage-backend.md`
3. Commit and push for test writer to begin (TDD RED).
