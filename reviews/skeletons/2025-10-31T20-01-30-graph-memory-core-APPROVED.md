**Status:** APPROVED

## Summary
Excellent update. The skeleton now includes comprehensive JSDoc for all public methods across MemoryGraph, Ontology, Registry, and StorageGateway. Contracts mirror the spec’s Tool inputs/outputs and error semantics. Structure remains hollow and testable with clean dependency injection.

## Contract Compliance
- ✓ All tools defined and registered (18 total)
- ✓ Public APIs in domain services documented (Args/Returns/Throws)
- ✓ Error types align with the spec’s error table
- ✓ Types cover nodes, connections, registry, ontology

## Testability Assessment
- ✓ Dependencies injectable via `GraphStorageGateway` and config
- ✓ No hard-coded storage or concrete implementations
- ✓ Interfaces minimal, segregation respected

## Completeness
- ✓ Module headers present
- ✓ Method JSDoc complete
- ✓ No `any` types; explicit type coverage

## Hollowness Verification
- ✓ All domain methods raise `NotImplementedError`
- ✓ No business logic, I/O, or control flow beyond minimal guards

## Quality Checks
- Linter/Type checker not configured (OK for skeleton); imports and ESM paths are coherent

## Minor Notes (non-blocking)
- In `MemoryGraph.createNode` JSDoc, `InvalidEncodingError` is listed; spec only uses that for `update_node`. Consider removing it from Tool 1 docs to avoid confusion.
- Optionally narrow `GraphMemoryErrorPayload.code` to the union of error codes for stronger typing.
- Adding a minimal `tsconfig.json` later will enable `tsc --noEmit` checks.

## Testability Score
- Dependency injection: Pass
- Interface abstractions: Pass
- Type completeness: Pass

## Decision
APPROVED — Ready for test-writer.

Next actions for skeleton-writer:
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/graph-memory-core`
2. Move spec: `git mv specs/todo/graph-memory-core.md specs/doing/graph-memory-core.md`
3. Commit and push
