## Vision Review Summary

**Overall Assessment**: Ready

**Strengths**:
- Complete structure: all mandatory sections present and sufficiently detailed (vision, problem, target users, value prop, product scope, success criteria, technical approach, assumptions/constraints, open questions).
- Clear problem framing with root causes and why it persists (e.g., `VISION.md:21`–`VISION.md:27`).
- Target users well specified with behavior, JTBD, pain points, and decision criteria (`VISION.md:64`, `VISION.md:71`, `VISION.md:79`).
- Differentiated value proposition with explicit alternatives and sustainability (`VISION.md:102`, `VISION.md:113`).
- Product scope shows strong boundaries: MVP, future, and explicit “Never in Scope” including user segments and problems not addressed (`VISION.md:119`, `VISION.md:164`).
- Success criteria include 5 concrete metrics with baselines and 6/12/36‑month goals plus guardrails and timeline milestones (`VISION.md:186`, `VISION.md:227`, `VISION.md:235`).
- Realistic solo‑dev constraints and risks with mitigation paths (`VISION.md:270`, `VISION.md:276`).

**Critical Issues (P0 - blocks planning)**:
- None. Document meets schema-vision requirements and is suitable for downstream work.

**Improvement Opportunities (P1 - reduces effectiveness)**:
- Tighten the vision statement for memorability. Current is strong but long. Example: “Help knowledge workers make confident, moment‑to‑moment choices by pairing permanent context memory with coaching that ends thrashing and decision fatigue.”
- Give the primary persona a concrete name in addition to the role to increase recall (e.g., “Solo Developer Sam” or “Consultant Casey”) while keeping the existing attributes (`VISION.md:49`).
- Operationalize two metrics for easier tracking:
  - Decision Confidence: define a 1–5 self‑report scale with targets (e.g., baseline ~2.5 → 3.8 at 6 mo → 4.3 at 1 yr) and cadence (weekly pulse).
  - Context Continuity: track “redundant restatement rate” (percentage of sessions requiring the user to re‑teach known facts) with targets (e.g., <10% by 6 mo, <5% by 1 yr) (`VISION.md:199`–`VISION.md:205`).
- Add an explicit “switch threshold” for graph storage (e.g., move from file‑based to DB when median query latency >1s at >N nodes/edges or when memory size >M MB) (`VISION.md:259`–`VISION.md:268`).
- Privacy note: expand guardrails to include data retention/erasure policy and local‑only default with opt‑in sync, referenced from Success Criteria guardrails (`VISION.md:227`–`VISION.md:234`).

**Anti-Patterns Detected**:
- None materially present. Technical specifics are rightly confined to Technical Approach (not the vision statement), avoiding solution lock‑in at the vision level.

**Readiness Assessment**:
- Ready for scope writing: Yes
- Ready for roadmap planning: Yes
- Blockers: None

**Next Steps**:
- Optionally incorporate the P1 refinements (shorter vision sentence, named persona, metric operationalization, storage switch criteria, privacy note).
- Proceed to SCOPE.md creation using the MVP “In Scope”, “Future”, and “Never” boundaries as primary inputs.
- Use Success Criteria timeline milestones to seed roadmap phases (6 mo, 1 yr, 3 yr).

**Recommendation**:
Approve and hand off to scope-writer. Use this vision as the grounding document; iterate on P1 improvements without delaying downstream planning.
