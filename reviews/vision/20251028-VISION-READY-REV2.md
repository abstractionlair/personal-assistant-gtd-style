## Vision Review Summary (Rev 2)

**Overall Assessment**: Ready

**What Changed Since Rev 1**:
- Vision statement tightened for memorability: `VISION.md:5`.
- Primary persona now has a concrete name: `VISION.md:49`.
- Context Continuity metric operationalized with “redundant restatement rate,” baseline and targets: `VISION.md:199`, `VISION.md:200`–`VISION.md:205`.
- Decision Confidence metric defined with 1–5 scale, baseline and targets: `VISION.md:214`–`VISION.md:220`.
- Privacy guardrails expanded with retention/erasure and local‑first default: `VISION.md:233`–`VISION.md:235`.
- Explicit storage switch threshold added for file‑based → embedded graph DB: `VISION.md:286`.

**Strengths (confirmed)**:
- Complete structure; aligns with schema-vision requirements across sections.
- Clear problem framing and user targeting; differentiation remains strong.
- Product scope boundaries are crisp (MVP/Future/Never) enabling downstream SCOPE.md.
- Success criteria include measurable metrics and timeline milestones suitable for ROADMAP.md.
- Constraints/risks and mitigations realistic for a solo developer.

**Critical Issues (P0)**:
- None.

**Minor Nits (P2, optional polish)**:
- Consider adding a short “Measurement Sources” note under metrics (e.g., where usage data is logged, where confidence pulse is stored) for later implementation traceability.
- In Technical Approach, note that thresholds are provisional and will be revisited after initial profiling to avoid premature optimization perceptions.

**Readiness Assessment**:
- Ready for scope writing: Yes
- Ready for roadmap planning: Yes
- Blockers: None

**Next Steps**:
- Proceed to SCOPE.md creation using MVP “In Scope,” “Future,” and “Never” sections.
- Seed ROADMAP.md from timeline milestones and metrics priorities.

**Recommendation**:
Approve and hand off to scope-writer. The incorporated refinements materially improve measurability and sustainability without changing direction.
