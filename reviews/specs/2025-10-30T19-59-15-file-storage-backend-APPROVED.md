# Spec Review: file-storage-backend

**Reviewer**: OpenAI Codex (Codex CLI)
**Date**: 2025-10-30
**Spec Version**: specs/proposed/file-storage-backend.md (v1.1)
**Status**: APPROVED

## Summary
The spec now cleanly resolves prior blockers and is implementable without
ambiguity. It standardizes JSON-safe content encoding (utf-8/base64) with
explicit `encoding`, defines MCP error codes/messages, clarifies symlink
containment (realpath checks), sets directory deletion to “truly empty,” nails
sorting (Unicode code point, ascending, case-sensitive), accepts trailing
slashes, and defines insert newline semantics. Constraints and implementation
notes reflect these rules.

## Checklist
- [x] Aligns with Vision/Scope/Roadmap
- [x] Interfaces specified (all tools, parameters, returns, errors)
- [x] Happy/edge paths covered
- [x] Error handling specified with MCP error mapping
- [x] Testability verified (clear, concrete acceptance criteria)
- [x] Dependencies identified

## Detailed Feedback
Minor non-blocking nits to tidy in a follow-up edit:
1) Scenario 5 wording: says “alphanumerically”; update to match spec’s
   “sorted by Unicode code point (ascending, case-sensitive)”.
2) Testing Strategy still says “Test all 20 acceptance criteria”; acceptance
   criteria count is now 24. Suggest “test all acceptance criteria.”
3) Scenario numbering order is slightly out of sequence (7 appears after 9).
   Not material, but consider reordering.

These are editorial only and do not block implementation.

## Approval Criteria
All prior approval requirements are met: JSON-safe encoding, symlink escape
handling, directory deletion semantics, MCP error mapping, and clarified
sorting/trailing-slash/insert behavior.

## Next Steps
- [x] Move spec to `specs/todo/`
- [ ] Skeleton Writer may begin interfaces and create the feature branch per workflow
