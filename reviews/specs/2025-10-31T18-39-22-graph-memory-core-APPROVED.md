# Spec Review: graph-memory-core

**Reviewer**: OpenAI Codex (Codex CLI)
**Date**: 2025-10-31
**Spec Version**: specs/proposed/graph-memory-core.md
**Status**: APPROVED

## Summary
All requested clarifications are resolved. The spec now treats `format` as opaque metadata, uses encoding-based file extensions (`utf-8` → .txt, `base64` → .bin) with clear examples, defines property constraints and matching semantics, explicitly states no property removal in MVP, specifies connection content path, and adds an AC that binary content is not searched. Interfaces and error codes are consistent and testable. Ready to proceed to implementation planning.

## Checklist
- [x] Aligns with Vision/Scope/Roadmap
- [x] Interfaces specified with parameters/returns/errors
- [x] Happy/edge/error paths covered
- [x] Testability verified (ACs map cleanly to tests)
- [x] Dependencies identified

## Next Steps
- [x] Move to `specs/todo/graph-memory-core.md`
- [ ] Prepare skeleton interfaces per the contract
- [ ] Open review-requests entry for skeletons if used in this project
