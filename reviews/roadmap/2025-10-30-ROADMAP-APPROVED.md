# Roadmap Review: Personal Assistant (GTD-Style)

**Reviewer**: Roadmap Reviewer
**Date**: 2025-10-30
**Document**: ROADMAP.md
**Version**: 1.0 (per Document Control)
**Status**: APPROVED

## Summary
The roadmap is complete, well-structured, and aligns tightly with VISION.md and SCOPE.md. It follows the schema with all required sections, presents clear phase definitions with measurable success criteria, and provides complete six-field feature entries that the spec-writer can consume directly. Sequencing logic is coherent: foundational storage → generic graph → GTD ontology → conversational layer, followed by a conditional path for coaching enhancements vs. core polish based on a clear validation checkpoint. Dependencies, risks, and flexibility provisions are explicitly documented. Ready for specification work.

## Ontology Compliance
- ✓ All required sections present (Overview, Alignment, Sequencing Strategy, Phase 1, Phase 2A/2B, Dependencies and Sequencing, Assumptions and Risks, Flexibility and Change, Document Control)
- ✓ Feature entries complete (6 fields each)
- ✓ Phase structure correct with goals, features, success criteria, learning goals, validation checkpoints

## Feature Entry Compliance ⚠ CRITICAL
- ✓ All features have Description field
- ✓ All features have Why now
- ✓ All features have Delivers
- ✓ All features have Derisks (uses "None" appropriately where applicable)
- ✓ All features have Depends on
- ✓ All features have Effort (Small/Medium/Large)

**Features missing fields**: None

## Sequencing Logic
- ✓ No circular dependencies observed
- ✓ Dependencies respected (foundations first; conditional Phase 2 path documented)
- ✓ Derisking strategy clear (Phase 1 validates highest-risk integration)
- ✓ Value delivery incremental (Phase 1 usable system; Phase 2A adds coaching; Phase 2B polishes core)

## Feature Coverage
- ✓ All SCOPE MVP core features represented in roadmap phases:
  - Conversational GTD capture → Phase 1 Conversational Layer
  - General graph memory system → Phase 1 Graph Memory Core + GTD Ontology
  - Observations and patterns layer → Phase 2A Observations Layer Integration
  - Pattern recognition → Phase 2A Pattern Recognition
  - Intelligent recommendations → Phase 2A Intelligent Recommendations
  - Conversational intelligence → Phase 2A Socratic Questioning
- ✓ No out-of-scope features introduced
- ✓ Future/conditional items consistent with SCOPE deferrals

**Missing SCOPE features**: None
**Extra features not in SCOPE**: None

## Alignment Check
- ✓ Vision statement matches VISION.md exactly
- ✓ Scope summary accurately reflects SCOPE.md
- ✓ Success criteria trace to vision success metrics via checkpoints

## Phase Quality
- ✓ Phase goals clear and outcome-oriented
- ✓ Phase sizes reasonable (3–7 features)
- ✓ Success criteria specific and measurable (checkboxes with concrete conditions)
- ✓ Validation checkpoints defined with review questions and decision criteria

## Critical Issues
None. The roadmap meets the quality bar for spec-writer consumption.

## Minor Issues
1. Effort parentheses vs. scale
   - Observation: Some parenthetical time ranges slightly diverge from the canonical scale (e.g., "Small (3–5 days)" vs. Small=1–3 days; Medium sometimes shown as 3–4 days vs. 4–7).
   - Impact: None functionally; labels are valid. Could cause mild inconsistency in planning.
   - Suggestion: Optionally align parenthetical ranges to the defined Small/Medium/Large scale for consistency.

2. Optional crosswalk for future readers
   - Observation: Feature coverage vs. SCOPE is correct but implicit.
   - Impact: None; verification already done here.
   - Suggestion: Add a brief bullet mapping SCOPE "Core Features" to roadmap phases to ease future audits.

## Decision
APPROVED – Ready for spec-writer to begin writing specifications, starting with Phase 1 features.
