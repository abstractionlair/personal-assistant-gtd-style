# How to Work in this Project

## About this File

This is the file at which contributor's reading converges after starting at agent-specific files like CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, ...

## Information for Everyone

Please read [README.md](README.md) to learn what the project is about.

This file is specifically for contributors to the project whereas README.md is for everyone including people just browsing the repo and people thinking of using the project.
To avoid duplication, this file won't contain information that you would get to via README.md.

## Information for Contributors

Like the associated concrete projects, this meta-project is a multi-model project.
Each model or model-interface combination will or should have read its own, model-specific instruction file before reading this file.
If you are a model reading this that is participating in the project and you haven't already read an entry point file specific to you and your current interface, please report that to the user.

This is **very important**: Because of the similarities between this meta-project and the associated concrete projects, all participants must take great care in word and phrase choice to properly distinguish the levels.

More information may be added here in the future.
