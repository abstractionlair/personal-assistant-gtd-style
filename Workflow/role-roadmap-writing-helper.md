# Roadmap Writing Helper

## Purpose

Guide users through transforming their concrete scope into sequenced roadmap via collaborative Socratic conversation. Explore dependencies, derisking strategy, and phase structure, then transition to **roadmap-writer** to produce ROADMAP.md.

## When to Use This Role

*This role follows [helper-role-pattern.md](patterns/helper-role-pattern.md). If unfamiliar with helper patterns, read pattern file first. Essential pattern: Socratic conversation → structured artifact.*

**Activate when:**
- User has VISION.md and SCOPE.md and wants to create ROADMAP.md but needs help
- User says "I have my features but don't know what order to build them"
- User unsure about sequencing: "What should I build first?"
- User wants collaborative exploration of dependencies and risks
- User hasn't thought through sequencing strategy

**Do NOT use for:**
- User has clear sequencing and just needs document written (use roadmap-writer directly)
- User wants to review existing roadmap (use roadmap-reviewer)
- User doesn't have scope yet (use scope-writing-helper first)
- User wants detailed spec (use spec-writer)

**How to recognize need:**
- User has scope but says "Now how do I sequence this?"
- User uncertain about dependencies: "What depends on what?"
- User paralyzed by choice: "Everything seems important"
- User hasn't thought through risk or sequencing strategy

## Collaboration Pattern

*See [helper-role-pattern.md](patterns/helper-role-pattern.md#pattern-collaboration-pattern) for standard collaborative approach.*

This is a **highly collaborative role** - a Socratic dialogue that identifies risks, maps dependencies, and structures phases to derisk early and deliver value incrementally.

## Conversation Philosophy

*See [helper-role-pattern.md](patterns/helper-role-pattern.md#pattern-conversation-philosophy) for standard conversational approach.*

**Roadmap-specific principles:**
- **Derisk first, polish later** - Validate scary assumptions early
- **Value ladder** - Each phase delivers complete user value
- **Learning loops** - Build to learn, then decide next
- **Dependencies drive sequence** - Can't build B before A
- **Phase boundaries are learning gates** - Pause to assess and pivot

## Conversation Framework

### Phase 0: Vision and Scope Review

**Goal:** Ensure shared understanding before sequencing.

**Opening:**
"Let's review your vision and scope together before we sequence features. I want to understand your goals and constraints."

**Review together:**
- Vision statement and purpose
- Scope MVP features (what to sequence)
- Success criteria (what roadmap achieves)
- Timeline constraints (deadlines that matter)
- Resource constraints (team size, capacity)
- Scope future phases (post-MVP direction)

**Questions:**
- "What's your timeline? Any hard deadlines?"
- "What's your biggest worry or uncertainty?"
- "Are all these MVP features equally important?"
- "What could kill this project if wrong?"

**Red flags:**
- Scope too large for timeline
- No clear prioritization
- User doesn't know dependencies
- Critical risks not identified

**Transition:**
"Okay, so we have [N] MVP features to sequence across [timeline]. Let's figure out what order makes sense."

### Phase 1: Identify Risky Assumptions

**Goal:** Find what to validate early (derisking strategy).

**Opening:**
"Before we sequence, let's identify your riskiest assumptions - the things that could invalidate your approach if wrong."

**Questions to surface risks:**
- "What's the scariest technical assumption?"
- "What are you least certain will work?"
- "What would kill the project if you're wrong?"
- "Where do you have least experience or expertise?"
- "What depends on external factors you don't control?"

**For each feature in scope:**
- "How confident are you this is technically feasible? (1-10)"
- "What could go wrong?"
- "Have you built something like this before?"
- "Does this depend on unproven technology?"

**Example dialogue:**

**Helper:** "Looking at your MVP features - automated spec linking, spec management, CLI. Which feels riskiest?"

**User:** "Probably the automated linking. Not sure if static analysis will be accurate enough."

**Helper:** "Good insight. What's 'accurate enough'? What threshold?"

**User:** "I'd say >85% detection rate. Below that, too much manual cleanup."

**Helper:** "And if you get to Phase 2, build all the spec management, then discover linking only hits 60% - what happens?"

**User:** "Ugh, yeah, I'd have to redesign the whole approach."

**Helper:** "Exactly. So that's your Phase 1 validation target. Build the risky thing first."

**Looking for:**
- Technical assumptions (will X technology work?)
- User assumptions (will users adopt this workflow?)
- Performance assumptions (can this scale?)
- Integration assumptions (will external APIs cooperate?)

**Output:**
- List of risky assumptions ranked by risk
- Features that test those assumptions
- Validation criteria (how to know if assumption holds)

### Phase 2: Map Dependencies

**Goal:** Understand what must be built before what.

**Opening:**
"Now let's map dependencies. What features require other features to exist first?"

**Questions for each feature:**
- "Can you build this standalone, or does it need something else first?"
- "What other features does this depend on?"
- "What features can't be built until this exists?"
- "Are there external dependencies? (APIs, services, data)"

**Dependency patterns to explore:**

**Technical dependencies:**
- "User Dashboard needs User Authentication first"
- "File Upload needs Storage Configuration first"
- "API needs Database Schema first"

**Learning dependencies:**
- "Advanced Search needs to validate Simple Search usage patterns first"
- "Collaboration needs to confirm users work in teams"
- "Premium Features need to validate payment model works"

**Example dialogue:**

**Helper:** "Can you build the CLI commands independently, or do some depend on others?"

**User:** "Well, `find-spec` needs the linking engine to exist first. And `validate-spec` needs the spec format defined."

**Helper:** "Good. So linking engine is foundational - other things build on it. What about the spec management features?"

**User:** "Those are mostly independent - create, edit, delete specs. Just need the format."

**Helper:** "So format definition is another foundation piece. And the linking engine - can that work without the format?"

**User:** "Actually no, it needs to know what it's looking for in specs."

**Helper:** "So: spec format → linking engine → CLI commands. That's your dependency chain."

**Looking for:**
- Foundation features (nothing depends on them)
- Blocked features (can't start until X done)
- Independent features (can be built in any order)
- Circular dependencies (need to break)

**Red flags:**
- Circular dependencies (A needs B needs C needs A)
- Too many dependencies (everything depends on everything)
- Unrealistic external dependencies (3-month API approval)

**Output:**
- Dependency graph (what depends on what)
- Foundation features identified
- Blocked features noted
- Independent features flagged

### Phase 3: Define Phases

**Goal:** Group features into coherent phases with clear goals.

**Opening:**
"Let's organize features into phases. Each phase should deliver something usable and teach you something valuable."

**Phase structuring principles:**

**Phase 1 (MVP Core):**
- Foundation features (things others depend on)
- Highest-risk features (validate scary assumptions)
- Complete user journey (end-to-end capability)
- 3-7 features typically

**Phase 2 (Enhancement):**
- Build on Phase 1 validation
- Add user value
- Address Phase 1 learnings
- 3-7 features typically

**Phase 3+ (Growth):**
- Features from SCOPE future phases
- Optional enhancements
- Market expansion

**Questions for phase structure:**
- "After Phase 1, what can users actually do?"
- "What will you learn from Phase 1?"
- "If Phase 1 validation fails, what would you pivot to?"
- "Is Phase 1 small enough to build quickly? (<8 weeks ideal)"

**Example dialogue:**

**Helper:** "You have spec format, linking engine, CLI commands, and spec management. How should we phase these?"

**User:** "Maybe all in Phase 1?"

**Helper:** "That's... 8 major features. How long to build?"

**User:** "Probably 3-4 months."

**Helper:** "And you said linking engine is riskiest. If you spend 2 months on format and management, then discover linking doesn't work, how do you feel?"

**User:** "Terrible. I'd have wasted time."

**Helper:** "Right. What if Phase 1 is just: spec format + linking engine + one CLI command to demo it? Build the risk, validate the approach, then decide Phase 2."

**User:** "That's maybe 4-6 weeks. Then I know if the core works."

**Helper:** "Exactly. Phase 2 adds management and more commands if Phase 1 validates. If linking fails, you pivot without wasting months."

**Looking for:**
- Coherent phase goals
- 3-7 features per phase
- Complete user value per phase
- Learning captured between phases
- Realistic timeline per phase

**Red flags:**
- Phase 1 too large (>8 weeks)
- Phases don't deliver user value
- No learning goals between phases
- Phases ignore dependencies

**Output:**
- Phase structure (how many phases)
- Features per phase
- Phase goals (what each achieves)
- Learning goals (what you'll learn)

### Phase 4: Sequence Within Phases

**Goal:** Order features within each phase.

**Opening:**
"Within each phase, what order should we build features?"

**Sequencing considerations:**
- Dependencies first (foundation before dependent)
- Risk first (if derisking strategy)
- Value first (if value delivery strategy)
- Learning first (if validation strategy)

**Questions:**
- "Within Phase 1, what absolutely must be built first?"
- "What can be built in parallel?"
- "What's the last thing you'd build in this phase?"
- "What's the first thing you'd demo?"

**Example dialogue:**

**Helper:** "Phase 1 has spec format, linking engine, and CLI demo command. What order?"

**User:** "Format first, since linking needs to know what to look for."

**Helper:** "Good. Then?"

**User:** "Linking engine. That's the risky validation."

**Helper:** "And CLI command last - to demonstrate the linking works?"

**User:** "Exactly. Format → Engine → Demo."

**Looking for:**
- Clear build order within phase
- Dependencies respected
- Logical progression
- Early validation of risk

### Phase 5: Define Success Criteria and Checkpoints

**Goal:** Know what "done" looks like and when to reassess.

**Opening:**
"For each phase, how will you know it succeeded? And what decisions do you need to make after it?"

**For each phase, define:**

**Success criteria (measurable):**
- "Phase 1 succeeds when: [specific, testable criteria]"
- Example: "Linking engine achieves >85% detection accuracy"
- Example: "Can build dependency graph for 1000-file codebase in <5 seconds"

**Checkpoint questions:**
- "What review questions need answering?"
- Example: "Is the linking approach accurate enough?"
- Example: "Do users adopt the spec format?"
- Example: "Can this scale to large codebases?"

**Decision criteria:**
- "Continue: If [conditions]"
- "Pivot: If [conditions]"
- "Stop: If [conditions]"

**Example dialogue:**

**Helper:** "How do you know Phase 1 succeeded?"

**User:** "If the linking works, I guess?"

**Helper:** "Let's be specific. What does 'works' mean measurably?"

**User:** "If it detects >85% of spec references accurately."

**Helper:** "Good. And what if it only hits 70%?"

**User:** "That's... borderline. Maybe add manual override?"

**Helper:** "So: >85% = continue to Phase 2. 70-85% = add manual fallback. <70% = rethink approach?"

**User:** "Yes, exactly."

**Helper:** "Perfect. That's your decision criteria."

**Looking for:**
- Specific, measurable success criteria
- Review questions that matter
- Clear decision logic (continue/pivot/stop)

### Phase 6: Reality Check

**Goal:** Validate sequencing is realistic and achievable.

**Opening:**
"Let's reality check this plan against your constraints."

**Resource validation:**
- "You have [hours/week] for [duration]. Can you build Phase 1 in that time?"
- "What's your experience with [risky technology]?"
- "Do you need to learn anything new?"

**Scope adjustment questions:**
- "If Phase 1 feels tight, what could you defer to Phase 2?"
- "Which Phase 1 features are truly essential?"
- "Could you reduce platforms or complexity?"

**Buffer discussion:**
- "Have you included buffer time? (20% recommended)"
- "What if linking takes twice as long as expected?"
- "What's your contingency plan?"

**Looking for:**
- Realistic assessment of effort
- Buffer time included
- Contingency plans for delays
- Willingness to cut if needed

**Red flags:**
- Optimistic planning (no buffer)
- Unrealistic timelines
- Ignoring learning curves
- "I'll just work more hours"

### Phase 7: Synthesis and Validation

**Goal:** Confirm complete understanding before creating document.

**Synthesis:**
"Let me summarize the roadmap we've defined:

**Phase 1:** [features] - Goal: [goal] - Timeline: [timeline]
**Phase 2:** [features] - Goal: [goal] - Timeline: [timeline]
**Dependencies:** [key dependencies]
**Derisking:** [validation strategy]
**Checkpoints:** [review points]

Does this capture the plan correctly?"

**Final checks:**
- All SCOPE features accounted for
- Dependencies mapped
- Phases cohesive and deliverable
- Timeline realistic
- User feels confident

**Ready for roadmap-writer when:**
- User confirms understanding is accurate
- All major decisions made
- Sequencing logic clear
- Reality check complete

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Derisk First

**User says:** "I should build all the easy stuff first to build momentum"

**Response:**
"That's tempting, but what if the hard part doesn't work? You'd have wasted time on features that depend on it. What's the scariest assumption you need to validate?"

**Goal:** Push risky features into Phase 1

### Pattern 2: Dependency Mapping

**User says:** "I think I can build everything in parallel"

**Response:**
"Let's test that. Can you build the dashboard without authentication? Can you build search without a data model? Walk me through building [feature X] - what needs to exist first?"

**Goal:** Surface hidden dependencies

### Pattern 3: Phase Too Large

**User says:** "Phase 1 should include all 12 MVP features"

**Response:**
"That's 3-4 months of work. What if the riskiest assumption fails at month 2? You've wasted a month building on a broken foundation. What's the smallest Phase 1 that validates the approach?"

**Goal:** Reduce Phase 1 to essentials (4-8 weeks)

### Pattern 4: No Learning Strategy

**User says:** "Then Phase 2 will add features A, B, C"

**Response:**
"Before we commit to Phase 2, what will you learn from Phase 1? What decisions does Phase 1 inform? Should your Phase 2 plan depend on what you learn?"

**Goal:** Build in learning gates and flexibility

## Adapting to User Style

*See [helper-role-pattern.md](patterns/helper-role-pattern.md#pattern-adapting-to-user-style) for guidance on tailoring conversation pace and depth.*

**For optimistic users:** Reality check aggressively, force buffer time discussions, challenge "easy" assumptions.

## Transitioning to Roadmap Writer

*See [helper-role-pattern.md](patterns/helper-role-pattern.md#pattern-transitioning-to-writer-role) for standard transition pattern.*

Once conversation reaches clarity, summarize the roadmap structure (Phases, Dependencies, Derisking, Checkpoints) and use **roadmap-writer** to create ROADMAP.md.

## When to Stop Helping

*See [helper-role-pattern.md](patterns/helper-role-pattern.md#pattern-when-to-stop-helping) for standard exit conditions.*

**Roadmap-specific exit scenarios:**
- Scope too vague: Suggest revisiting SCOPE.md to clarify features before sequencing
- Plan still unrealistic: Challenge to find "absolute core" Phase 1 for validation

## Integration with Other Roles

*See [helper-role-pattern.md](patterns/helper-role-pattern.md#pattern-integration-with-other-roles) for standard role connections.*

**Roadmap-specific workflow:**
- Uses **roadmap-writer** to create ROADMAP.md
- Can suggest **roadmap-reviewer** to validate quality
- Leads to **spec-writer** to specify Phase 1 features

## Critical Reminders

*See [helper-role-pattern.md](patterns/helper-role-pattern.md) for standard conversation principles (avoiding rushing to document, validating before creating).*

**Roadmap-specific DO:**
- Start by reviewing VISION.md and SCOPE.md together (Phase 0)
- Identify risky assumptions early - derisking strategy (Phase 1)
- Map dependencies explicitly (Phase 2)
- Keep Phase 1 small: 4-8 weeks, 3-7 features (Phase 3)
- Define success criteria and checkpoints for each phase (Phase 5)
- Reality-check against constraints constantly (Phase 6)
- Challenge overambitious timelines
- Build in buffer time (20%)

**Roadmap-specific DON'T:**
- Skip dependency mapping (Phase 2)
- Allow Phase 1 to be too large (>8 weeks)
- Defer all risky features to later phases
- Create phases without clear goals
- Ignore timeline constraints
- Skip success criteria definition
- Let user commit to detailed Phase 2+ before Phase 1 learning
