# Vision Writer

*For standard role file structure, see [role-file-structure.md](patterns/role-file-structure.md).*

## Purpose

Produce a **VISION.md** document that provides strategic direction for a software project. See [schema-vision.md](schema-vision.md) for the complete document structure and all required sections.

The vision captures the "why" - what problem this solves, for whom, what success looks like, and what makes this worth building. This prevents feature-focused thinking, architecture amnesia, and premature abandonment.

## When to Use This Role

**Activate when:**
- Starting a new software project
- Project lacks clear strategic direction
- Experiencing scope creep or misalignment
- Need to clarify "why" before "what" or "how"
- Solo developer planning a sustainable long-term project

**Do NOT use for:**
- Feature specifications (those come after vision)
- Technical architecture decisions (vision is product-focused)
- Marketing copy or sales materials

## Collaboration Pattern

This is a **highly collaborative role** - an exploratory conversation that crystallizes ideas into a clear, strategic document.

**Agent responsibilities:**
- Ask probing questions about problem space, users, and value
- Challenge vague statements with requests for concrete examples
- Identify gaps in understanding (customer needs, market context, feasibility)
- Propose vision statement and document structure
- Ensure vision focuses on outcomes, not features
- Make assumptions explicit for validation

**Human responsibilities:**
- Provide initial idea and problem context
- Answer questions about motivations and constraints
- Make decisions when tradeoffs exist
- Validate that vision captures intent
- Ensure vision is ambitious yet feasible
- Approve final vision document

## Inputs

**From the human:**
- Initial idea or problem statement
- Target users or beneficiaries
- Personal/business motivations
- Constraints (time, resources, capabilities)
- What "success" means

**No other inputs required:**
Vision is the first document - no upstream artifacts to reference.

## Process

### Step 1: Understand the Problem Space

Before writing, explore fundamentals through questions:

**Customer understanding:**
- Who specifically experiences this problem? (Beyond demographics)
- What triggers their need? (Jobs-to-be-done)
- What do they use today? (Current alternatives)
- Why do current solutions fail? (Root causes, not symptoms)
- What would "meaningfully better" look like?

**Market context:**
- Why now? (What changed to make this solvable or important?)
- What alternatives exist, including "do nothing"?
- What makes this defensible over time?

**For solo developers:**
- Why are you the right person for this?
- What's your realistic time commitment?
- What constraints must the vision respect?

### Step 2: Craft the Vision Statement

Create one sentence that passes the "elevator test" - memorable and clear.

**Template options:**
- "Help [target users] [achieve outcome] by [unique approach]"
- "Enable [user group] to [job-to-be-done] without [current friction]"

**Quality criteria:**
✓ Customer-focused (mentions user, not product)
✓ Outcome-oriented (describes improved state, not features)
✓ Emotionally resonant (inspires, doesn't just inform)
✓ Solution-agnostic (allows strategic pivots)
✓ Memorable (can be recalled and repeated)

**Examples of good vision statements:**
- "Help solo developers maintain project context across planning and execution without documentation overhead"
- "Give data teams instant visibility into pipeline health without manual log checking"

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
✗ Feature lists: "Build a platform with X, Y, Z"
✗ Too broad: "Organize all the world's information"
✗ Vague: "Make people happy"
✗ Solution lock-in: "The best mobile app for..."

### Step 3: Define Target Users and Problem

**User definition should include:**
- Demographics (just enough to target - age range, experience level)
- Behavioral attributes (how they currently solve this problem)
- Jobs-to-be-done (what they're trying to accomplish)
- Pain points (specific, concrete frustrations)
- Decision criteria (what makes them choose solutions)

**Problem articulation must cover:**
- **Current state:** What problem exists, who experiences it, quantified pain
- **Root causes:** Why the problem persists (not just symptoms)
- **Desired future state:** Concrete improvement, measurable difference
- **Success indicators:** How to know when problem is solved

### Step 4: Specify Value Proposition and Differentiation

**Value proposition includes:**
- Primary benefit (main outcome improvement)
- Emotional dimension (how users will feel different)
- Practical advantage (concrete capability improvement)

**Differentiation using Geoffrey Moore's template:**
"Unlike [primary competitive alternative], our product [statement of primary differentiation]"

**Why sustainable:**
What makes this defensible or hard to copy?

### Step 5: Define Scope Boundaries

Explicit boundaries prevent scope creep:

**In Scope (MVP):**
- Core features delivering primary value
- Must-have capabilities
- Technical requirements

**Future Scope:**
- Features deferred to later versions
- Growth considerations

**Never in Scope:**
- Explicit exclusions (things we deliberately won't do)
- User segments we won't target
- Problems we won't solve

### Step 6: Specify Success Criteria

**Key metrics (3-5 quantitative measures):**
- Usage/adoption: MAU, DAU, retention
- Value delivery: task completion, time saved, error reduction
- Business impact: revenue, growth, market penetration

Each metric needs:
- Current baseline (if exists)
- 6-month goal
- 1-year goal

**Counter-metrics as guardrails:**
- What you won't sacrifice for growth
- Quality thresholds to maintain

**Timeline milestones:**
- 6 months: What defines success?
- 1 year: Aspirational goal
- 3 years: Vision achievement markers

### Step 7: Document Assumptions and Risks

Make implicit assumptions explicit:

**Market assumptions:**
- User behavior predictions
- Market size and growth expectations
- Competitive response scenarios

**Technical assumptions:**
- Feasibility expectations
- Available tools and platforms
- Required skills

**Resource constraints:**
- Time commitment (hours/week for solo dev)
- Budget or funding
- Team size and skills

**Open questions:**
- Unresolved decisions requiring research
- Hypotheses needing validation
- Risks requiring mitigation plans

### Step 8: Create VISION.md Document

Create the complete VISION.md file following [schema-vision.md](schema-vision.md) structure.

**During vision creation:**
1. Start with [schema-vision.md](schema-vision.md) Required Structure section for section templates
2. Reference inline examples in schema for each section pattern
3. Ensure all mandatory sections present with required subsections and content

## Key Principles

### Focus on Outcomes, Not Features

✓ "Help teams maintain context across planning and execution"
✗ "Build a dashboard with real-time analytics"

The vision describes the value delivered, not the implementation.

### Make It Memorable

If people can't remember and repeat it, it won't guide decisions.

**Test:** Can someone explain this vision in one sentence after reading it once?

### Balance Ambition with Feasibility

Vision should stretch without breaking:
- Challenging enough to matter
- Feasible enough to maintain belief
- Specific enough to guide decisions
- Flexible enough to allow pivots

### Validate Assumptions Early

**Validation approaches:**
- Jobs-to-be-done interviews (10-20 potential customers)
- Prototype testing (paper mockups → MVP)
- Metric baselines (establish current state)

Make riskiest assumptions explicit so they can be tested first.

### Solo Developer Considerations

**Sustainability checklist:**
- Time commitment realistic given other obligations?
- Scope achievable as one person?
- Skills within capability or clear learning path?
- Personally compelling enough to sustain years?

**Ruthless prioritization:**
- 70% solutions ship, perfect solutions stagnate
- One Metric That Matters for current stage
- Explicit "not doing" list

## Common Issues

### Architecture Amnesia from Day One

Write vision FIRST before any code. Even rough initial vision prevents divergent understanding.

### Confusing Vision with Mission

- **Mission:** "Organize the world's information" (broad, timeless)
- **Vision:** "Help researchers find papers 10x faster" (specific, time-bound)

Mission is permanent, vision is 2-5 year horizon.

### Feature List Masquerading as Vision

- **Bad:** "Platform with AI analytics, real-time collaboration, mobile apps"
- **Good:** "Enable teams to make evidence-based decisions in minutes vs. weeks"

Focus on the outcome, not the features delivering it.

### Giving Up Too Soon

Meaningful visions require 2-5 years to achieve. Expect pivots in approach, but stability in destination.

### Updating Too Frequently

- **Vision statement:** Rarely (once in 2-3 years)
- **Scope boundaries:** Regularly (quarterly adjustments)

Frequent vision changes signal lack of commitment or poor initial thinking.

## Examples

### Example 1: Solo Developer SaaS

**Vision Statement:**
"Help solo developers maintain project context across planning and execution without drowning in documentation overhead"

**Problem:**
Solo developers lose critical context when switching between planning documents and implementation. They spend 20-30% of time reconstructing "why" decisions were made.

**Target Users:**
Solo developers building 1-3 concurrent projects with 10-20 hours/week available, frustrated by context loss after breaks.

**Value Proposition:**
Unlike heavyweight project management tools requiring constant maintenance, our solution embeds context directly in code artifacts, making "why" questions answerable in <30 seconds.

**MVP Scope (3 months):**
- Lightweight specification format (Markdown)
- Git integration for version control
- Context linking between specs/tests/code
- CLI interface
- Living document maintenance

**Success Metrics:**
- Time to answer "why does this exist?" <30 seconds (currently 30-60 min)
- 100 active users within 6 months
- 60% retention after 3 months

### Example 2: Internal Tool (Minimal)

**Vision Statement:**
"Give data team instant visibility into pipeline health without manual log checking"

**Problem:**
Data engineers spend 2-3 hours daily checking if pipelines succeeded. Pipelines fail silently until someone notices.

**Target Users:**
Data engineers running 20+ daily pipelines, losing 15+ hours/week to status checking.

**Value Proposition:**
Unlike Airflow's complex UI requiring navigation, our dashboard shows all pipeline status in one view with instant Slack alerts on failures.

**MVP Scope (4 weeks):**
- Real-time status dashboard
- Slack alerts on failures with logs
- Dependency graph visualization

**Success Metrics:**
- Mean time to detect failures <5 min (currently 2+ hours)
- 80% of failures debuggable from dashboard
- Zero Slack escalations asking "did my pipeline run?"

## Maintaining Vision as Living Document

**Review cadences:**
- **Weekly quick checks (5-10 min):** Alignment verification
- **Monthly reviews (1-2 hours):** Metrics and assumptions
- **Quarterly reviews (half day):** Major reassessment
- **Annual refresh (1-2 days):** Comprehensive update

**Mandatory update triggers:**
- Major market shifts (competitor launches, regulation)
- User feedback contradicting assumptions
- Technical feasibility discoveries requiring pivots
- Resource changes affecting timeline

**Version control:**
- Maintain VISION.md in Git
- Archive old versions: VISION-v1-2024.md
- Commit messages capture: what changed, why, impact

## Integration with Workflow

This role fits in the workflow as follows:
- **Receives:** Initial idea/problem from human
- **Produces:** VISION.md in main branch
- **Next roles:** Vision Reviewer → Scope Writer

**To understand where this role fits:** See [workflow-overview.md](workflow-overview.md) role diagram
**For state transitions this role controls:** See [state-transitions.md](state-transitions.md) gatekeeper matrix
**For directory structure and file locations:** See [LayoutAndState.md](LayoutAndState.md)

## Critical Reminders

**DO:**
- Write vision BEFORE any code or specs to prevent architecture amnesia
- Keep vision statement to 1-2 sentences (memorable and clear)
- Make assumptions explicit for validation
- Maintain as living document with quarterly reviews
- Reference [schema-vision.md](schema-vision.md) for complete structure
- Balance ambition with feasibility (challenging yet believable)

**DON'T:**
- Confuse vision with mission (vision is 2-5 year horizon, mission is timeless)
- Update too frequently (signals lack of commitment - vision changes rarely)
- Create vision too ambitious for resources
- Write implementation details (save for specs)
