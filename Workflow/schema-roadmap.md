# ROADMAP.md Ontology

## Purpose

This document defines the canonical structure, content, and semantics of ROADMAP.md files. It serves as the authoritative reference for:
- **roadmap-writer** (producer): What to create
- **spec-writer** (consumer): What to expect
- **Reviewers**: What to validate

## Document Type

**Format:** Markdown (.md)  
**Producer:** roadmap-writer  
**Primary Consumer:** spec-writer (reads feature entries)  
**Secondary Consumers:** Planning reviewers, stakeholders

## Required Structure

### Document Header

```markdown
# [Project Name] Roadmap
```

**Requirements:**
- Project name matches VISION.md and SCOPE.md
- Single H1 heading

---

## Section 1: Roadmap Overview

```markdown
## Roadmap Overview

[2-3 sentences explaining sequencing strategy]
```

**Purpose:** High-level summary of how features are sequenced and why

**Content Requirements:**
- 2-3 sentences (concise)
- Explains sequencing approach (e.g., "derisk early", "value ladder")
- References key principles or constraints
- Provides context for phase structure

**Example:**
```
This roadmap sequences features to derisk technical approach early while 
delivering immediate user value through progressive capability addition. We 
start with the riskiest technical challenge (static analysis linking), then 
layer user value with specs and living docs.
```

## Section 3: Sequencing Strategy

```markdown
## Sequencing Strategy

### Key Principles
[3-5 principles guiding feature sequence]

### Risk Mitigation Approach
[How roadmap derisks critical assumptions]

### Value Delivery Pattern
[How roadmap delivers user value incrementally]
```

**Purpose:** Explain the "why" behind feature sequencing

**Subsections:**

### 3.1 Key Principles
**Content:** 3-5 principles that guided sequencing decisions
**Format:** Numbered or bulleted list
**Example:**
```
1. Derisk technical linking first - Most novel/risky capability
2. Deliver complete user journeys - Usable value at each phase
3. Validate with real usage - Get features in front of users ASAP
4. Build infrastructure as needed - JIT, not upfront
5. Maintain development flow - Group related features
```

### 3.2 Risk Mitigation Approach
**Content:** How roadmap addresses risk (especially in early phases)
**Length:** 1-3 paragraphs
**Must specify:** Which risks, when mitigated, how validated

### 3.3 Value Delivery Pattern
**Content:** How roadmap delivers value across phases
**Format:** Usually phase-by-phase summary
**Example:**
```
Each phase delivers a complete user capability:
- Phase 1: Can link code to specs (core value)
- Phase 2: Can create and manage specs
- Phase 3: Can maintain living docs automatically
```

  - "Email validation approach"
  - "Query performance concerns"
  - "None (low-risk polish feature)"

#### Depends on (REQUIRED)
- **Content:** Prerequisites that must be complete first
- **Format:** Feature names or "Nothing"
- **Can be:** "Nothing" if no dependencies

### 4.3 Success Criteria
**Content:** Observable conditions that indicate phase completion
**Format:** Checklist (using `- [ ]` syntax)
**Requirements:**

```

### 4.4 Learning Goals
**Content:** What we'll learn from building this phase
**Format:** Bulleted list or paragraph
**Must specify:** Questions answered, assumptions validated, feedback obtained
**Example:**
```
- Does static analysis work reliably enough?

```

### 6.2 Sequencing Risks
**Content:** What could go wrong with this sequence
**Format:** Bulleted list

- Be understandable without context
- Avoid implementation details
- Use 1-2 sentences maximum

**Sequencing rationale must:**
- Explain why this feature in this phase
- Reference principles from Sequencing Strategy
- Be specific (not vague like "important")

### Consistency Standards

**Cross-document:**

- Feature dependencies reference actual feature names
- Effort estimates consistent in scale

---

## Common Issues

### Issue 1: Missing Feature Descriptions
**Problem:** Feature entries lack Description field
**Impact:** spec-writer cannot understand what feature is
**Fix:** Add 1-2 sentence description to every feature

### Issue 2: Vague Descriptions
**Problem:** Descriptions like "Static analysis" or "API work"
**Impact:** Insufficient context for spec-writer
**Fix:** Make descriptions specific and complete

### Issue 3: Implementation in Description
**Problem:** Descriptions include how feature works
**Impact:** Over-constrains implementation
**Fix:** Focus on what feature does (behavior) not how (implementation)

### Issue 4: Missing Dependencies
**Problem:** Features list "Nothing" but actually depend on other features
**Impact:** Sequencing breaks, features can't be built
**Fix:** Trace dependencies carefully, list all prerequisites

### Issue 5: Unmeasurable Success Criteria
**Problem:** Criteria like "Phase complete when done"
**Impact:** No clear definition of phase completion
**Fix:** Use specific, testable conditions

## Downstream Usage

### spec-writer Consumption

**Reads from ROADMAP.md:**
- Feature name → SPEC title
- Feature description → SPEC overview foundation
- Why now → SPEC rationale context
- Delivers → SPEC value proposition
- Depends on → SPEC dependencies section
- Effort → SPEC complexity estimate

**Critical:** All 6 fields must be present for spec-writer to function

### Planning Review

**Reviewers validate:**
- Sequencing follows stated principles
- Dependencies correctly identified
- Effort estimates reasonable
- Success criteria measurable
- Risks identified and mitigated

### Stakeholder Communication

**Stakeholders use roadmap for:**
- Understanding feature sequence
- Knowing when capabilities delivered
- Seeing rationale for priorities
- Tracking progress via checkpoints

---

## Version Control

**Roadmap lifecycle:**
1. **Initial:** Created by roadmap-writer after SCOPE.md complete
2. **Living:** Updated after validation checkpoints
3. **Versioned:** Changes tracked in Version History section
4. **Archived:** Old versions preserved in git history

**Update triggers:**
- Validation checkpoint reveals need for change
- Stakeholder feedback requires adjustment
- External constraint changes (timeline, resources)
- Major assumption invalidated

## Related Schemas

**When creating this artifact:**
- Read [schema-vision.md](schema-vision.md) for strategic alignment
- Read [schema-scope.md](schema-scope.md) for features to sequence
- Apply sequencing principles (value, risk, learning, dependencies)

**After creating this artifact:**
- Next: [schema-spec.md](schema-spec.md) details individual features

## Summary

ROADMAP.md is the bridge between strategic planning (VISION, SCOPE) and tactical execution (SPEC). It defines:
- **What** to build (features)
- **When** to build it (phases)
- **Why** that sequence (rationale)
- **How** to adapt (flexibility)

**Most critical for downstream:** Feature entries with complete 6-field structure enable spec-writer to transform roadmap features into detailed specifications.
