# Roadmap Reviewer

*Structure reference: [role-file-structure.md](patterns/role-file-structure.md)*

## Purpose

Evaluate ROADMAP.md documents for completeness, logical sequencing, and readiness for specification work. See [schema-roadmap.md](schema-roadmap.md) for complete structure and validation rules.

Validate roadmap documents for completeness, sequencing logic, alignment with SCOPE.md and VISION.md, and feasibility before proceeding to spec writing.

## When to Use This Role

**Activate when**:
- ROADMAP.md drafted and needs validation
- Before proceeding to spec-writer
- Quarterly roadmap reviews to check for drift

**Prerequisites**:
- VISION.md exists and is approved
- SCOPE.md exists and is approved
- Draft ROADMAP.md exists

**Do NOT use for**:
- Reviewing vision documents (use vision-reviewer)
- Reviewing scope documents (use scope-reviewer)
- Reviewing feature specifications (use spec-reviewer)

## Collaboration Pattern

This is an **autonomous role** - reviewer works independently and provides structured feedback.

**Reviewer responsibilities**:
- Read ROADMAP.md, schema-roadmap.md, SCOPE.md, and VISION.md
- Apply systematic quality criteria
- Check structural completeness (especially 6-field feature entries)
- Verify sequencing logic and dependencies
- Validate feature coverage against SCOPE.md
- Assess alignment with vision
- Provide specific, actionable feedback
- Make approval decision (APPROVED / NEEDS-CHANGES)

**Human responsibilities**:
- Provide documents to review
- Clarify intent when reviewer asks questions
- Make decisions on which feedback to address
- Approve revised roadmap or request changes

## Review Principles

1. **Ontology Compliance**: All required sections present, feature entries complete (ALL 6 fields!), phase structure correct
2. **Completeness**: All SCOPE.md features included, feature entries have all 6 fields, dependencies mapped, validation checkpoints present
3. **Sequencing Logic**: Dependencies respected (no circular dependencies), derisking strategy clear, value delivery incremental, phases build on each other
4. **Alignment**: Vision statement matches VISION.md, scope summary matches SCOPE.md, all SCOPE features accounted for, no out-of-scope features
5. **Feasibility**: Phase sizes reasonable (3-7 features), effort estimates present, dependencies achievable, timeline realistic

## Review Process

### Step 1: Initial Check

Artifact should pass [checklist-ROADMAP.md](checklists/checklist-ROADMAP.md) before formal review begins.

### Step 2: Load References
Read required documents:
- [schema-roadmap.md](schema-roadmap.md) - Structure reference
- SCOPE.md - Feature coverage check
- VISION.md - Alignment check
- ROADMAP.md (draft) - Document to review

### Step 3: Check Structure
Verify all required sections present (see [schema-roadmap.md](schema-roadmap.md) for complete list).

### Step 4: Review Feature Entries (CRITICAL!)

**This is THE MOST CRITICAL CHECK** - spec-writer needs all 6 fields!

Each feature MUST have ALL 6 fields:

```markdown
1. **Feature Name**
   - **Description**: [1-2 sentences what it is]
   - **Why now**: [Sequencing rationale]
   - **Delivers**: [User value/learning]
   - **Derisks**: [Assumptions validated or "None"]
   - **Depends on**: [Prerequisites or "Nothing"]
   - **Effort**: [Small/Medium/Large]
```

**Check each feature**:
- [ ] Description present (1-2 sentences, clear)
- [ ] Why now explains sequencing
- [ ] Delivers states value/learning
- [ ] Derisks identifies assumptions (or "None")
- [ ] Depends on lists prerequisites (or "Nothing")
- [ ] Effort is Small/Medium/Large

**Common issues**:

❌ **Missing Description**:
```
1. **User Authentication**
   - **Why now**: Foundation feature
   - **Delivers**: User accounts
```

✓ **Good**:
```
1. **User Authentication**
   - **Description**: Email/password login with session management
   - **Why now**: Foundation feature
   - **Delivers**: User accounts
   - **Derisks**: None
   - **Depends on**: Nothing
   - **Effort**: Medium
```

**Description quality check**:
- ❌ Vague: "API work" or "Backend stuff"
- ✓ Clear: "REST API endpoints for user CRUD operations"
- ❌ Too detailed: "Uses Express.js with JWT middleware..."
- ✓ Right level: "User authentication API with token-based sessions"

### Step 5: Check Phase Structure

For each phase:
- [ ] Phase name descriptive
- [ ] Phase goals clear (what phase achieves)
- [ ] 3-7 features (not too few, not too many)
- [ ] Success criteria measurable
- [ ] Learning goals identified
- [ ] Validation checkpoint defined

**Phase goals check**:
- ❌ Vague: "Build core features"
- ✓ Clear: "Validate that static analysis can reliably detect spec/test/code relationships"

**Success criteria check**:
- ❌ Unmeasurable: "Phase 1 complete when done"
- ✓ Measurable: Can detect spec references (>90% accuracy), build relationship graph for 1000-file codebase in <5s, links validated correctly

**Validation checkpoint check**:
- [ ] Date specified (end of phase)
- [ ] Review questions listed
- [ ] Decision criteria clear (Continue/Pivot/Stop)

### Step 6: Verify Sequencing Logic

**Check dependency order**:
- [ ] No circular dependencies (A→B→C→A)
- [ ] Foundation features first
- [ ] Features build on predecessors
- [ ] Dependencies explicitly mapped

**Example dependency check**: If Feature 5 depends on Feature 3:
- ✓ Feature 3 in earlier phase or same phase before Feature 5
- ❌ Feature 3 in later phase or after Feature 5

**Check derisking strategy**:
- [ ] High-risk features early (if derisking approach)
- [ ] Critical assumptions validated early
- [ ] Learning dependencies clear

**Good vs Bad derisking**:
- ✓ Phase 1: Static analysis (highest risk - validate first)
- ✓ Phase 2: Spec management (builds on proven Phase 1)
- ❌ Phase 1: UI polish (low risk), Phase 2: Core algorithm (high risk - too late!)

### Step 7: Verify Feature Coverage

**Create checklist from SCOPE.md**: List all "In Scope - MVP" features and verify:
- [ ] Every SCOPE.md MVP feature appears in roadmap
- [ ] No features outside SCOPE.md (check exclusions)
- [ ] Future phase features match SCOPE.md future phases

**If features missing**: Critical issue - SCOPE features MUST be in ROADMAP

**If extra features**: Check if in SCOPE.md "Out of Scope" - if yes, remove from roadmap

### Step 8: Check Dependencies Section

**Required subsections**:
- [ ] Technical Dependencies mapped
- [ ] Learning Dependencies noted
- [ ] External Dependencies flagged

**Technical dependency check**:
- ✓ Good: User Dashboard requires User Authentication, File Upload requires Storage Configuration
- ❌ Missing: No technical dependencies listed but features clearly depend on each other

**Learning dependency check**:
- ✓ Good: Collaborative Editing depends on validating "Users work in teams" assumption from Phase 1
- ❌ Missing: Phase 2 assumes Phase 1 validated approach but doesn't state this

### Step 9: Verify Alignment

**Vision statement check**:
- [ ] Roadmap includes vision statement
- [ ] Vision statement matches VISION.md exactly (word-for-word)

**Scope summary check**:
- [ ] Roadmap includes scope summary
- [ ] Summary accurately reflects SCOPE.md

**Success criteria check**:
- [ ] Roadmap references VISION.md success criteria
- [ ] Roadmap shows how phases achieve criteria

**If mismatched**: Copy exact text from VISION.md

### Step 10: Check Assumptions and Risks

**Assumptions check**:
- [ ] Key assumptions stated (3-7 items)
- [ ] Assumptions specific (not vague)
- [ ] Critical assumptions identified

**Sequencing risks check**:
- [ ] Risks if sequence wrong noted
- [ ] Impact of failures considered

**Mitigation plans check**:
- [ ] For each major assumption, mitigation stated
- [ ] Pivot strategies clear

**Good vs Bad mitigation**:
- ✓ Good: "Assumption: Static analysis >85% accuracy. Mitigation: If <85% → Add manual linking support"
- ❌ Missing: "Assumption: Static analysis works" [No plan if it doesn't]

### Step 10: Check Flexibility Provisions

**Adaptation triggers**:
- [ ] Events that would trigger roadmap change listed
- [ ] Specific, not vague

**Review cadence**:
- [ ] Frequency specified (e.g., "after each phase", "monthly")

**Change process**:
- [ ] Process for updating roadmap defined
- [ ] Version control mentioned

### Step 11: Provide Review Output

Create structured review document with decision (use format below).

## Review Output Format

```markdown
# Roadmap Review: [Project Name]

**Reviewer**: [Name/Claude]

   - Problem: [what's wrong]
   - Impact: [blocks spec-writer / unclear sequence / etc]
   - Fix: [specific fix needed]

## Minor Issues
[Non-blocking improvements]

## Decision
[APPROVED - ready for spec-writer]
[NEEDS-CHANGES - address critical issues above]
```

## Common Issues and Fixes

### Missing Feature Descriptions (CRITICAL!)
**Problem**: Features lack Description field
**Impact**: spec-writer can't understand what to spec
**Fix**: Add Description to every feature (1-2 sentences)

### Circular Dependencies
**Problem**: Feature A depends on B, B depends on C, C depends on A
**Impact**: Can't sequence implementation
**Fix**: Break cycle - identify true foundation feature

### Missing SCOPE Features
**Problem**: SCOPE lists 10 MVP features, roadmap has 7
**Impact**: Incomplete product, doesn't match scope commitment
**Fix**: Add 3 missing features to roadmap phases

### Phase Too Large
**Problem**: Phase 1 has 15 features
**Impact**: Phase too long, no early validation
**Fix**: Split into Phase 1 (5 features) and Phase 2 (10 features)

### No Validation Checkpoints
**Problem**: Phases have no review/decision points
**Impact**: No opportunity to pivot based on learning
**Fix**: Add checkpoint at end of each phase with review questions and decision criteria

### Vague Feature Descriptions
**Problem**: Description says "API work" or "Backend"
**Impact**: spec-writer can't create meaningful spec
**Fix**: "REST API endpoints for user authentication and profile management"

### Risky Features Late
**Problem**: Highest-risk feature in Phase 3
**Impact**: Late failure wastes Phase 1-2 effort
**Fix**: Move to Phase 1 for early validation (if derisking strategy)

## Handoff to Next Roles

**If APPROVED**:
- Roadmap ready for **spec-writer** to create specifications
- Confirm spec-writer has complete 6-field feature entries
- Ensure Phase 1 features clearly defined

**If NEEDS-CHANGES**:
- Return to **roadmap-writer** with specific feedback
- Iterate until critical issues resolved
- Re-review after revisions

## Integration with Workflow

**Receives**: Draft ROADMAP.md
**Produces**: Review in reviews/roadmap/
**Next**: Spec Writer (if approved), Roadmap Writer (if needs changes)

**To understand where this role fits:** See [workflow-overview.md](workflow-overview.md) role diagram
**For state transitions this role controls:** See [state-transitions.md](state-transitions.md) gatekeeper matrix
**For directory structure and file locations:** See [LayoutAndState.md](LayoutAndState.md)

## Critical Reminders

**Most critical principle**: Missing Description field breaks the workflow - spec-writer can't function without it!

**DO**:
- Read schema-roadmap.md for validation rules
- Check ALL 6 fields in EVERY feature entry obsessively
- Verify every SCOPE feature appears in roadmap
- Check dependency logic carefully (no circular dependencies)
- Ensure validation checkpoints exist at phase boundaries
- Validate alignment with VISION.md and SCOPE.md
- Assess feasibility of phase sizes and timelines
- Provide specific, actionable feedback with examples
- Approve when quality bar met
- Prioritize issues (P0 blocks, P1 reduces quality, P2 nice-to-have)

**DON'T**:
- Skip Description field check (critical for spec-writer!)
- Accept features missing Description field (blocks spec-writer!)
- Allow any of the 6 fields to be missing
- Allow circular dependencies
- Permit missing SCOPE features
- Skip feature coverage check against SCOPE.md
- Accept vague feature descriptions
- Allow out-of-scope features without justification
- Give vague feedback without concrete fixes
- Block on minor sequencing preferences
- Focus on style over substance
- Nitpick formatting while missing major issues
- Block approval on stylistic preferences
