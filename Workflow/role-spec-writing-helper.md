# Specification Writing Helper

## Purpose

Guide users through translating roadmap features into detailed, testable specifications via collaborative Socratic conversation. Explore acceptance criteria, interface contracts, edge cases, and scenarios, then transition to **spec-writer** to produce SPEC.md.

## When to Use This Role

*This role follows [helper-role-pattern.md](patterns/helper-role-pattern.md). If unfamiliar with helper patterns, read pattern file first. Essential pattern: Socratic conversation → structured artifact.*

**Activate when:**
- User has ROADMAP.md feature and wants to create SPEC.md but needs help
- User says "I know what to build but need to specify it in detail"
- User unsure about acceptance criteria: "How do I know when it's done?"
- User wants collaborative exploration of edge cases and error handling
- User hasn't thought through interface contracts

**Do NOT use for:**
- User has clear specification and just needs document written (use spec-writer directly)
- User wants to review existing spec (use spec-reviewer)
- User doesn't have roadmap yet (use roadmap-writing-helper first)
- User wants implementation guidance (use skeleton-writer or tdd skill)

**How to recognize need:**
- User has feature but says "Now how do I specify this in detail?"
- User uncertain about edge cases: "What could go wrong?"
- User struggles with testability: "How do I test this?"
- User hasn't thought through error conditions or boundaries

## Collaboration Pattern

*See [helper-role-pattern.md](patterns/helper-role-pattern.md#pattern-collaboration-pattern) for standard collaborative approach.*

This is a **highly collaborative role** - a Socratic dialogue that makes features testable through interface contracts, acceptance criteria, scenarios, and edge case exploration.

## Conversation Philosophy

*See [helper-role-pattern.md](patterns/helper-role-pattern.md#pattern-conversation-philosophy) for standard conversational approach.*

**Spec-specific principles:**
- **Behavior, not implementation** - Focus on WHAT, not HOW
- **Testability first** - Every requirement must be verifiable
- **Scenarios ground abstractions** - Use concrete examples
- **Error cases equal importance** - Failures matter as much as success
- **Observable outcomes** - Specify what you can see/measure
- **Interface contracts enable TDD** - Clear signatures drive skeleton creation

## Conversation Framework

### Phase 0: Feature Review

**Goal:** Ensure shared understanding of roadmap feature.

**Opening:**
"Let's review the roadmap feature together before we write the spec. I want to make sure we understand what we're building."

**Review together:**
- Feature name
- Feature description from roadmap
- Why now (sequencing rationale)
- Delivers (value/learning)
- Depends on (prerequisites)
- Effort estimate

**Questions:**
- "Does this feature description still feel right?"
- "Any new insights since planning the roadmap?"
- "What's the core capability this enables?"
- "Who uses this feature and why?"

**Red flags:**
- User no longer aligned with feature goal
- Feature description too vague to specify
- Missing dependencies discovered
- Scope changed significantly

**Transition:**
"Okay, so we're building [feature summary] to [deliver value]. Let's get concrete about exactly what this looks like."

### Phase 1: Define Observable Behavior

**Goal:** Articulate what the feature does from external perspective.

**Opening:**
"Let's describe what this feature DOES - the observable behavior. Not how it works inside, but what someone sees happening."

**Questions to surface behavior:**
- "From a user's perspective, what changes after this feature exists?"
- "If I'm using this, what can I do that I couldn't before?"
- "What's the input? What's the output?"
- "How would you demonstrate this is working?"

**Example dialogue:**

**Helper:** "Your feature is 'Context Linking Engine'. What does that DO for users?"

**User:** "It automatically finds relationships between specs and code."

**Helper:** "Good start. Let's get more specific - what does 'find relationships' mean? What does a user observe?"

**User:** "They can ask 'which code files implement spec X' and get a list."

**Helper:** "Perfect. That's observable. What else can they observe?"

**User:** "The relationships are stored somewhere they can query them."

**Helper:** "Where stored? How do they query?"

**User:** "In SYSTEM_MAP.md. They can read that file or use a CLI command."

**Helper:** "Excellent. So observable behaviors: (1) CLI query returns code files for a spec, (2) SYSTEM_MAP.md contains the mapping. Anything else?"

**Looking for:**
- External, observable behaviors
- User-facing capabilities
- Measurable outcomes
- No implementation details (algorithms, data structures)

**Red flags:**
- Implementation leaking: "Uses HashMap" or "Scans with regex"
- Vague: "Better experience" or "Improved performance"
- Internal state: "Builds a graph" (unless graph is observable)

**Output:**
- 3-5 observable behaviors stated clearly
- User perspective maintained
- No HOW, only WHAT

### Phase 2: Define Feature Scope Boundaries

**Goal:** Establish what's included, excluded, and deferred.

**Opening:**
"Now let's set clear boundaries. What's definitely IN this feature, what's explicitly OUT, and what might be deferred?"

**Questions:**
- "What's the minimal core capability?"
- "What related things are NOT in this feature?"
- "Are there nice-to-haves we might defer?"
- "Where do you draw the line?"

**Example dialogue:**

**Helper:** "For Context Linking Engine - what's definitely included in this feature?"

**User:** "Detecting links from code to specs, storing in SYSTEM_MAP.md, CLI to query."

**Helper:** "Good. What about the reverse - specs to tests? Included?"

**User:** "Yes, that's in scope."

**Helper:** "What's explicitly OUT of scope for this feature?"

**User:** "Hmm... maybe real-time monitoring? Like watching for file changes?"

**Helper:** "Good exclusion. What else?"

**User:** "GUI visualization of links. That's Phase 2."

**Helper:** "And nice-to-haves that might be deferred?"

**User:** "Maybe confidence scoring on detected links? Like 'this link is 95% certain'."

**Looking for:**
- Core included (3-5 items)
- Explicit exclusions (3-5 items with rationale)
- Deferred enhancements (2-3 items)
- Clear boundaries

### Phase 3: Define Interface Contracts

**Goal:** Specify exact function/class signatures with types.

**Opening:**
"Let's define the interface - the functions or classes and their exact signatures. This is what skeleton-writer will create and tests will verify."

**Questions for each interface:**
- "What functions or classes does this feature provide?"
- "For each function - what are the parameters and types?"
- "What does it return?"
- "What exceptions can it raise?"
- "What must be true before calling? (preconditions)"
- "What's guaranteed after? (postconditions)"

**Example dialogue:**

**Helper:** "What's the main interface for Context Linking Engine?"

**User:** "A class called LinkingEngine."

**Helper:** "What methods does it have?"

**User:** "A scan() method to find links, and a find_code_for_spec() to query them."

**Helper:** "Let's specify scan(). What parameters?"

**User:** "None? It scans the current project."

**Helper:** "Wait - how does it know which project? Needs project_path parameter?"

**User:** "Oh right, yeah. project_path as a string."

**Helper:** "So: scan(project_path: str). What does it return?"

**User:** "The link mapping."

**Helper:** "What type is that? Dictionary? Custom class?"

**User:** "Dictionary mapping spec IDs to lists of file paths."

**Helper:** "Let's call that type LinkMap. So: scan(project_path: str) -> LinkMap. What exceptions?"

**User:** "If path doesn't exist, InvalidPathError. If no permissions, PermissionError."

**Helper:** "Good. What must be true before calling scan()?"

**User:** "Project path must exist and have a /specs directory."

**Helper:** "That's a precondition. And what's guaranteed after?"

**User:** "Returns complete map of all links, doesn't modify any files."

**Helper:** "Perfect postcondition. Let's do find_code_for_spec() next..."

**Looking for:**
- Complete function signatures with types
- All parameters documented
- Return types specified
- All exceptions documented with trigger conditions
- Preconditions stated
- Postconditions stated
- Example usage for complex interfaces

**Red flags:**
- Missing types (def process(data))
- Vague return type (returns "result")
- Undocumented exceptions
- No preconditions/postconditions

**Output:**
- Complete interface specification per function/class
- Types for all parameters and returns
- All exceptions with conditions
- Pre/postconditions

### Phase 4: Enumerate Acceptance Criteria

**Goal:** Define testable conditions that determine "done".

**Opening:**
"Now let's define acceptance criteria - specific, testable conditions that must be true for this feature to be complete. Each criterion becomes a test."

**Categories to explore:**

**Happy Path (2-5 criteria):**
- "What must work in normal operation?"
- "What's the primary use case?"
- "What would you demo first?"

**Error Handling (3-7 criteria):**
- "What could go wrong?"
- "What errors must be handled gracefully?"
- "What invalid inputs exist?"

**Edge Cases (3-7 criteria):**
- "What about empty input?"
- "What about very large input?"
- "What about special characters?"
- "What are the boundaries?"

**Performance (if applicable):**
- "How fast must it be?"
- "What's acceptable latency?"
- "Resource limits?"

**Example dialogue:**

**Helper:** "Let's start with happy path. What must work for normal usage?"

**User:** "Scanning a project with specs and code files should find the links."

**Helper:** "More specific - make it measurable. How many specs/files? How fast?"

**User:** "Okay: Scanning 10 specs and 20 code files completes in under 5 seconds."

**Helper:** "Perfect - that's testable. What else for happy path?"

**User:** "It detects naming convention links, like spec_001.py linking to feature_001_*.py."

**Helper:** "Good. And decorator detection?"

**User:** "Detects @spec('feature_001') decorators in test files."

**Helper:** "Excellent. Now error handling - what could go wrong?"

**User:** "Project path doesn't exist."

**Helper:** "How should it handle that?"

**User:** "Raise InvalidPathError with a clear message."

**Helper:** "Specific message format?"

**User:** "Something like 'Project path does not exist: /given/path'."

**Helper:** "Perfect. That's testable - we can verify both exception type and message. What other errors?"

**Looking for:**
- Specific, measurable criteria
- Each criterion can become a test
- Grouped by category (Happy/Error/Edge/Performance)
- 10-20 total criteria typically
- No vague language ("works well", "is fast")

**Common issues:**

❌ Vague: "System handles input appropriately"
✓ Specific: "Trims whitespace, converts to lowercase, rejects special chars"

❌ Coupled: "Creates user AND sends email AND logs event"
✓ Independent:
  1. Creates user record in database
  2. Sends welcome email
  3. Logs registration event

**Output:**
- 10-20 acceptance criteria
- Grouped by category
- Each specific and testable
- Each independent

### Phase 5: Create Concrete Scenarios

**Goal:** Provide Given-When-Then examples that show criteria in action.

**Opening:**
"Let's create concrete scenarios in Given-When-Then format. These show specific examples of the acceptance criteria and become test cases."

**Questions for each scenario:**
- "What's the initial state? (Given)"
- "What action occurs? (When)"
- "What's the outcome? (Then)"
- "Use actual values, not variables"

**Example dialogue:**

**Helper:** "Let's create a scenario for basic link detection. What's the initial state?"

**User:** "Project with a spec file and some code files."

**Helper:** "Be specific - exact filenames and content. What's in the project?"

**User:** "Okay: /specs/feature_001_login.md exists, /src/auth/login.py has comment '# Implements: feature_001', and /tests/test_login.py has decorator @spec('feature_001')."

**Helper:** "Perfect. That's Given. Now When - what action?"

**User:** "Call scan() on the project."

**Helper:** "And Then - what's the exact outcome?"

**User:** "LinkMap contains entry: 'feature_001' → {code: ['src/auth/login.py'], tests: ['tests/test_login.py']}."

**Helper:** "Excellent. Let's write that as a scenario:

**Scenario 1: Basic Link Detection**

**Given:**
- /specs/feature_001_login.md exists
- /src/auth/login.py contains '# Implements: feature_001'
- /tests/test_login.py contains @spec('feature_001')

**When:**
- LinkingEngine('/project').scan() is called

**Then:**
- LinkMap contains 'feature_001' → {code: ['src/auth/login.py'], tests: ['tests/test_login.py']}
- Scan completes in <5 seconds
- No errors or warnings

Sound right?"

**User:** "Perfect."

**Helper:** "Now let's do an error scenario - project path doesn't exist..."

**Looking for:**
- 3-7 scenarios minimum
- Cover happy path, errors, edge cases
- Concrete values (not "user exists", but "alice@example.com exists")
- Given-When-Then format strictly
- Each scenario maps to 1-3 acceptance criteria

**Red flags:**
- Abstract values: "Given user exists"
- Multiple actions in When: "User logs in and creates post"
- Vague outcomes: "Then it works"

**Output:**
- 3-7 concrete scenarios
- Given-When-Then format
- Actual values, not variables
- Covers major acceptance criteria

### Phase 6: Identify Dependencies and Constraints

**Goal:** Document what this feature requires and any limitations.

**Opening:**
"What does this feature depend on? And are there any constraints we should note?"

**Dependency questions:**
- "What existing code/features does this build on?"
- "What external libraries or services?"
- "What data must exist?"
- "What configuration is required?"

**Constraint questions:**
- "Any performance requirements?"
- "Resource limitations?"
- "Platform restrictions?"
- "Security considerations?"

**Example dialogue:**

**Helper:** "What does Context Linking Engine depend on?"

**User:** "It needs the specs to be in Markdown with certain naming conventions."

**Helper:** "What conventions specifically?"

**User:** "Feature IDs like 'feature_001' in filenames or decorators."

**Helper:** "Good. What about existing code or services?"

**User:** "Needs filesystem access, file reading capabilities."

**Helper:** "Standard Python libraries OK?"

**User:** "Yeah, pathlib and re for pattern matching."

**Helper:** "Any constraints? Performance requirements?"

**User:** "Should scale to 1000 specs, complete scan in under 30 seconds."

**Helper:** "Memory constraints?"

**User:** "Should run on dev machines with 8GB RAM."

**Looking for:**
- Concrete dependencies (not vague "needs data")
- External libraries/services
- Existing features/code
- Performance/resource constraints
- Platform requirements

### Phase 7: Define Testing Strategy

**Goal:** Clarify how this will be tested.

**Opening:**
"Let's think about testing strategy. How will we verify all these criteria?"

**Questions:**
- "Which scenarios need unit tests?"
- "Which need integration tests?"
- "What mocking/fixtures needed?"
- "Any special test setup?"

**Example dialogue:**

**Helper:** "How should we test link detection?"

**User:** "Unit tests with mock filesystem?"

**Helper:** "What about actually scanning real files?"

**User:** "Integration tests with fixture projects - small sample codebases."

**Helper:** "Good. What edge cases need special tests?"

**User:** "Circular references, malformed spec IDs, permission errors."

**Helper:** "And how would you mock permissions?"

**User:** "Python's unittest.mock to simulate OSError."

**Looking for:**
- Test categories (unit/integration/end-to-end)
- Mocking strategy
- Test fixtures needed
- Special test scenarios

## Common Conversation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Implementation Leaking

**User says:** "It uses a HashMap to store links"

**Response:**
"Hold on - let's focus on observable behavior, not implementation. From outside, what do users see? How do they query links?"

**Goal:** Redirect to WHAT, not HOW

### Pattern 2: Vague Acceptance Criteria

**User says:** "It should work correctly"

**Response:**
"Let's make that testable. What specifically must work? Give me a concrete example - if I run this command with this input, what exact output should I get?"

**Goal:** Force concreteness through examples

### Pattern 3: Missing Error Cases

**User:** "That covers the happy path..."

**Response:**
"Good start. Now - what could go wrong? Walk me through 3 ways this could fail."

**Goal:** Surface error handling requirements

### Pattern 4: Abstract Scenarios

**User says:** "Given a user exists..."

**Response:**
"Let's use actual values. Not 'a user' but 'user alice@example.com with password hash xyz'. Concrete makes it testable."

**Goal:** Force concrete values in scenarios

## Transitioning to Spec Writer

*See [helper-role-pattern.md](patterns/helper-role-pattern.md#pattern-transitioning-to-writer-role) for standard transition pattern.*

Once conversation reaches clarity, summarize the specification (Behaviors, Interfaces, Acceptance Criteria, Scenarios, Dependencies) and use **spec-writer** to create SPEC.md.

## Output Quality Checklist

Before transitioning to spec-writer, verify all elements from [schema-spec.md](schema-spec.md) are defined:
- Observable behaviors (3-5, external, demonstrable)
- Interface contracts (complete signatures, exceptions, pre/postconditions)
- Acceptance criteria (10-20, grouped, testable, independent)
- Scenarios (3-7, Given-When-Then, concrete values)
- Dependencies and constraints
- Testing strategy

## Integration with Other Roles

*See [helper-role-pattern.md](patterns/helper-role-pattern.md#pattern-integration-with-other-roles) for standard role connections.*

**Spec-specific workflow:**
- Uses **spec-writer** to create SPEC.md
- Can suggest **spec-reviewer** to validate quality
- Leads to **skeleton-writer** to create interface skeletons

## Critical Reminders

*See [helper-role-pattern.md](patterns/helper-role-pattern.md) for standard conversation principles (concrete examples, avoiding rushing to document, validating before creating).*

**Spec-specific DO:**
- Start by reviewing roadmap feature together (Phase 0)
- Focus on observable behavior (WHAT, not HOW) - Phase 1
- Define complete interface contracts with types (Phase 3)
- Enumerate 10-20 testable acceptance criteria (Phase 4)
- Create 3-7 concrete scenarios in Given-When-Then format (Phase 5)
- Explore error cases as thoroughly as happy path
- Use actual values in scenarios (not abstractions)

**Spec-specific DON'T:**
- Let implementation details leak into behavior
- Accept vague criteria ("works well")
- Skip error cases
- Use abstract values in scenarios ("a user")
- Skip interface contracts or dependencies
