**Status:** Research findings from October 2025 - Subject to rapid change. Tentative.
**Source:** System context from initial Claude Code session
**Purpose:** Evidence base for model-to-role mapping decisions

## Executive Summary

Recent research (October 2025) shows that different AI coding models have distinct specializations across software development tasks. The consensus among multiple sources is that no single model dominates all tasks - the most effective approach is using specialized models for their strengths within a coordinated workflow.

## Task-Specific Model Performance

- **Grok 4 Fast**: Speed-optimized variant with same 2M token context, ideal for high-speed triage/analysis with massive context advantage

**Use Cases:**
- Features requiring current information
- API integrations with live data
- Social platform awareness
- Real-time feature implementation where speed + current information + large context are all needed

## Multi-Model Workflow Approach

### Creator vs. Critic Pattern

Research shows that using different models by design in "Creator vs. Critic lanes" - where one model writes patches and another only reviews/tests, never mixing roles in the same step - consistently boosts pass rates on SWE-bench-style tasks.

### Recommended Workflow Patterns

**Spec-first gates**: Have planner models (GPT-5/Claude) produce specifications before implementation

**Adversarial review**: Use Claude Sonnet for challenging assumptions and finding edge cases

**Context-aware routing**: Match model to task complexity and type:
- Transform/edit scripts → Gemini 2.5 Pro
- Greenfield or multi-file features → GPT-5-Codex
- Bug hunts/safety reviews → Claude Sonnet
- Cheap batches (docstrings, tests) → Claude Haiku 4.5
- On-prem CI checks → Codestral/Llama 4/DeepSeek/Qwen

## Converged Task-to-Model Allocation

Based on synthesis of multiple allocation proposals, here is the converged single-model allocation for the 11 development workflow tasks:

| Task | Model | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| 1. Writing project scope | **GPT-5** | Strong at broad business reasoning and structured planning |
| 2. Writing project plans/roadmaps | **GPT-5** | Closely related to scope; excels at mermaid diagrams and strategic breakdowns |
| 3. Reviewing scope/plans/roadmaps | **Claude Sonnet 4.5** | ≠ GPT-5; catches 23% more subtle issues; finds gaps and inconsistencies |
| 4. Writing specifications/contracts | **Claude Sonnet 4.5** | Best at technical precision, safety considerations, and architectural intent |
| 5. Reviewing specifications/contracts | **GPT-5** | ≠ Claude; challenges assumptions from different perspective |
| 6. Writing skeleton interfaces | **GPT-5-Codex** | Explicitly optimized for greenfield code; ~75% SWE-bench Verified |
| 7. Reviewing skeleton interfaces | **Gemini 2.5 Pro** | ≠ GPT-5-Codex; excellent at performance/scalability analysis; 1M token context for holistic view |
| 8. Writing tests (TDD) | **Claude Sonnet 4.5** | Tests-as-criticism philosophy; writing tests = finding failure modes |
| 9. Reviewing tests | **Grok 4** | Deep algorithmic review; avoids Claude-reviews-Claude; brings fresh perspective |
| 10. Implementing features | **GPT-5-Codex** | Leads implementation benchmarks; optimized for end-to-end feature work |
| 11. Reviewing implementations | **Claude Sonnet 4.5** | ≠ GPT-5-Codex; superior bug detection; best for adversarial review |

### Model Distribution Summary

- **GPT-5**: 3 tasks (1, 2, 5) - Strategic planning & adversarial spec review
- **Claude Sonnet 4.5**: 4 tasks (3, 4, 8, 11) - Critical review, specs, tests, final validation
- **GPT-5-Codex**: 2 tasks (6, 10) - All implementation work
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: 1 task (7) - Architectural interface review
- **Grok 4**: 1 task (9) - Specialized test logic review

### Key Constraints Satisfied

1. **Creator≠Reviewer**: Every review task uses a different model than its corresponding creation task
2. **Vendor diversity**: OpenAI (GPT-5, GPT-5-Codex), Anthropic (Claude Sonnet 4.5), Google (Gemini 2.5 Pro), xAI (Grok 4)
3. **Proven strengths**: Aligns with benchmark evidence and practical testing
4. **Natural workflow progression**: GPT-5 plans → Claude specifies & criticizes → GPT-5-Codex implements → Gemini validates architecture → Grok validates logic → Claude reviews final implementation

## Open-Source & Cost-Conscious Alternatives

For teams needing open-source or self-hosted options:

- **Claude Haiku 4.5**: Fast, lightweight tasks like triage, summarizing diffs, and test scaffolding
- **Mistral Codestral 25.01**: Leads many code-gen tests among open models
- **DeepSeek V3.x**: Strong open-source alternative for reasoning tasks
- **Llama 4 Maverick**: On-premise work
- **Qwen2.5 Coder**: On-premise development

## Benchmark References

## Important Caveats

1. **Rapid Change**: Model capabilities are evolving quickly; this research is from October 2025
2. **Task Dependency**: "Best" model depends on specific task type, latency needs, context window, and deployment constraints
3. **Small Accuracy Gaps**: Among top models, accuracy differences are often small on many tests
4. **Practical Tradeoffs**: Cost, speed, and availability often matter as much as raw capability
5. **Version Sensitivity**: Specific model versions matter (e.g., "Claude 4.5 Sonnet" vs "Claude 4 Opus")

## Design Inspiration

The tiered model stack approach reflects how advanced development teams now operate: moving from "which assistant should I use?" to "how do I orchestrate a team of AI specialists?" - each with distinct strengths playing complementary roles.
