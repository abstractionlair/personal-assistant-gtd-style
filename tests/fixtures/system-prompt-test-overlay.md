<!-- Intentionally minimal. Core guidance (style, safety, mode-specific behavior) now lives in the base system prompt
     and the Live MCP overlay. This file remains to avoid breaking the test bundling pipeline. -->

# Test Overlay (Empty)

This overlay is intentionally empty. The base prompt already covers:
- Natural, user‑first language; concise confirmations
- Safety & ambiguity guardrails
- Live MCP behavior with real tool execution
- Non‑fabrication and ID handling rules
