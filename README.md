Work in progress.

I am trying to make a personal assistant (initially) with Claude Code as the interface. An MCP server offering simple graph storage with typed nodes and links stores a DAG of committments, to do items, etc so that they survive clearing or compacting of the cache. A converstional layer (will) allow natural language conversations with the assistant who will keep track of things. The interaction style will be GTD-based, or at least flavored.

This is also a test case for the multi-model, multi-role workflow developed in https://github.com/abstractionlair/dev_workflow_meta. (But I've started on a major refactoring of that since starting this project.)
