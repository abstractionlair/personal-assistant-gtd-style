# Routing to Custom Instructions

In this project we are maintaing separate instructions for different tools/interfaces/CLIs/TUIs.
Please follow these routing instructions.

- OpenAI Codex (Codex CLI): read [CODEX.md](CODEX.md) next. Ignore the rest of this file.
- OpenCode (OpenCode TUI, opencode): read [OPENCODE.md](OPENCODE.md) next. Ignore the rest of this file.
- If AGENTS.md is your "official" initial instruction file
  - report to the user that instructions for you need to be written. Ignore the rest of this file.
- Otherwise (e.g. AGENTS.md isn't one of your official startup file, you're just browsing)
  - ignore this file.
