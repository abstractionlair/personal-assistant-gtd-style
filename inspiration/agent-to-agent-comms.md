procedure when implementer requests test changes".

⏺ I've read through the documentation DAG. I can see the project is a meta-project designing a multi-model AI-augmented software development workflow with TDD principles,
  formal review gates, and role-based specialization.

  Regarding your todo item "Spell out procedure when implementer requests test changes", I can see there's already guidance in the workflow:

  Current guidance (role-implementer.md:222-241 & workflow-roles-index.md:320-330):

  1. Implementers MUST NOT modify tests to make them pass
  2. If test seems wrong: Stop, document the concern with evidence, request test re-review, wait, resume after fix

  However, this guidance is fairly high-level. Let me discuss what aspects need to be spelled out more fully:

  Questions to clarify the procedure:

  1. Formal request mechanism: How does the implementer formally request a test re-review? Should there be a specific document format or location (e.g.,
  reviews/test-change-requests/)?
  2. Decision authority: Who makes the final call on whether a test change is justified? The test reviewer? The human? The original test writer?
  3. Scope of re-review: Does the test reviewer need to re-review the entire test suite, or just the specific test(s) in question?
  4. Branch management: What happens to the feature branch while waiting? Stay on it? Document the blocked state?
  5. Tracking & audit: How do we document that a test was modified post-approval? Should reviews track "REVISED" status?
  6. Disagreement resolution: What if test writer/reviewer disagree with implementer's assessment?
  7. Common scenarios: Should we document common legitimate reasons for test changes vs. red flags?

  Which of these aspects do you want me to develop? Or should I create a comprehensive "test-change-request-procedure.md" document covering all of these?

> I have considered the idea of letting writers/implementers directly call the other roles. See ../mcp-servers/codex-review for a step in that direction which we used in 
another project. We'd need more to make the idea work in the new workflow. At minimum we need to invoke "roles" not specific CLIs.

⏺ Ah, I see! The codex-review MCP server is a concrete example where you wrapped a specific CLI (codex) to make it callable from within Claude Code sessions. But that's too
  specific - it's hardwired to the codex CLI.

  For the new workflow, you need a role invocation layer that's decoupled from specific models/CLIs. The architecture would look like:

  Current (codex-review):
  Claude Code → mcp__codex_review tool → codex CLI → GPT-5 Codex

  Needed for new workflow:
  Implementer role → invoke("test-reviewer", context) →
    Role Dispatcher →
      Model Mapping (config) →
        CLI/API Adapter →
          Actual Model (Claude Sonnet 4.5 / Codex / Gemini / etc.)

  This would enable:
  - Implementer calls: invoke("test-reviewer", {tests: "...", concern: "..."})
  - Config-driven mapping: test-reviewer → claude-sonnet-4.5 → claude CLI
  - Swappable backends: Change mapping without changing role code
  - Cross-role invocation: Any role can invoke any other role

  Key architectural questions:

  1. Invocation mechanism: MCP tools? Special syntax in role prompts? Dedicated orchestration layer?
  2. Role context passing: How does implementer pass the necessary context (spec, tests, concern) to test-reviewer?
  3. Configuration format: How to map roles → models → CLIs?
  {
    "roles": {
      "test-reviewer": {
        "model": "claude-sonnet-4.5",
        "adapter": "claude-cli"
      },
      "implementer": {
        "model": "gpt-5-codex",
        "adapter": "codex-cli"
      }
    }
  }
  4. Return handling: How does the calling role receive and process the invoked role's output?

  Should I draft a design doc for this role invocation system? Or explore one specific aspect first?

> Well, I'd like your opinion on it first. 

⏺ Looking at this design problem, I see several architectural options with real tradeoffs. Let me think through them:

  Key Architectural Options

  Option 1: MCP Server Per Role

  Each role gets its own MCP server (like mcp__test_reviewer, mcp__implementer).

  Pros: Clean separation, easy to add roles
  Cons: Massive boilerplate, configuration hell, hard to test

  Option 2: Single Orchestration MCP Server

  One mcp__invoke_role tool that handles all role invocations.

  Pros: Single configuration point, easier maintenance, simpler testing
  Cons: God object, single bottleneck, needs machine-readable role definitions

  Option 3: Convention-Based Filesystem

  Roles write request documents, file watcher picks them up, invokes role, writes response.

  Pros: Artifact-driven (fits workflow philosophy!), async naturally, auditable
  Cons: Needs external orchestrator, slower, not interactive

  Option 4: Prompt-Level Convention

  Special markdown syntax like @test-reviewer that gets intercepted.

  Pros: Natural for LLMs, human-readable, no infrastructure
  Cons: Fragile magic syntax, hard to parse reliably, unclear processor

  My Recommendation: Hybrid

  Single Orchestration MCP Server that's artifact-aware:

  Claude Code (Implementer)
    ↓ calls
  mcp__invoke_role(
    role="test-reviewer",
    context={
      spec: "specs/doing/feature.md",
      tests: "tests/test_feature.py", 
      concern: "..."
    }
  )
    ↓
  Role Orchestrator
    ↓ loads
  role-test-reviewer.md (existing .md file - no duplication!)
    ↓ consults
  workflow-config.json (maps role → model → CLI)
    ↓ invokes
  Appropriate CLI adapter
    ↓ returns
  Structured response + saves full review to disk

  Configuration:

  {
    "roles": {
      "test-reviewer": {
        "model": "claude-sonnet-4.5",
        "adapter": "claude-cli"
      },
      "implementer": {
        "model": "gpt-5-codex",
        "adapter": "codex-cli"
      }
    }
  }

  Why This Works

  1. Role definitions stay as .md - Single source of truth, no duplication
  2. Config-driven model mapping - Change models without touching roles
  3. Extensible - New role = new .md + config entry
  4. Works with existing architecture - MCP is how Claude Code gets tools already
  5. Artifact-driven - Can save invocations/responses to disk for audit
  6. Testable - Orchestrator is just a Node process

  Critical Design Questions

  1. Context Passing

  Pass file paths (artifact-driven) or inline content (self-contained)?
  - I lean toward paths - stays artifact-driven, invoked role reads what it needs

  2. Sync vs Async

  Implementer blocked until test-reviewer responds, or continue working?
  - For test change requests: sync makes sense (implementer is blocked anyway)
  - But support async for longer reviews

  3. Response Format

  JSON? Markdown? Both?
  - Hybrid: Structured summary (JSON) for immediate use + full review saved to disk

  4. Role Awareness

  Should role definitions explicitly say "you can invoke other roles"?
  - Yes - Makes capability discoverable, enables proactive use
  - Add section to each role: "## Cross-Role Invocations"

  Main Concerns

  1. Cost - Every invocation = API calls. With GPT-5, expensive.
  2. Latency - Synchronous invocations block caller
  3. Context size - Large test suites might exceed token limits
  4. Circular dependencies - Need depth limits
  5. Debugging - Nested invocations get complex

  My Honest Assessment

  This is worth doing because:
  - Solves real problem (implementer requesting test changes)
  - Fits workflow philosophy (artifact-driven, role-based)
  - Scales to other cross-role needs (spec-reviewer calling spec-writer, etc.)

  But start minimal:
  1. Build orchestrator for ONE use case: test change requests
  2. Validate it works in practice
  3. Expand to other invocations as needed

  The codex-review MCP proves the technical feasibility. The orchestration layer just generalizes it.

  Question back to you: Do you want synchronous (blocking) or asynchronous invocations for the test change request case? I could argue either way.

> Well, I'd like your _general_ opinion on the entire idea of enabling this. We could discuss how we would implement it later. 

⏺ Okay, stepping back to the fundamental question: Should roles be able to invoke other roles at all?

  My Core Assessment: This is a Double-Edged Sword

  It Fundamentally Conflicts with the Workflow's Design Principles

  The workflow is built on:
  1. Human-as-manager - Humans approve gates, agents execute
  2. Artifact-driven state - Repository files are truth, not conversation
  3. Formal review gates - Creator ≠ reviewer
  4. Accountability - Clear ownership of decisions

  Role-to-role invocation undermines all of these:
  - Agents now manage other agents (not human-as-manager)
  - Interactions happen in tool calls/conversations (not artifact-driven)
  - Reviews can be requested/approved without human oversight (weakens gates)
  - When nested calls fail, who's accountable?

  But... It Could Make the Workflow Actually Usable

  The current workflow is very heavyweight:
  - Every cross-role interaction requires human mediation
  - Implementer hits issue → stop, document, wait for human, human decides, human invokes reviewer, etc.
  - For a solo developer, this becomes exhausting

  Reality check: If every small decision requires 5 manual steps, the workflow dies from friction.

  The Critical Distinction

  I think there are actually two different things here:

  A) Role Orchestration - Implementer role autonomously invokes test-reviewer role
  - This is radical, undermines human-as-manager
  - Creates cascading agent decisions
  - High risk of losing control

  B) Consultative Tools - Within ONE role session, ability to get second opinions
  - Like codex-review: Human talks to Claude, Claude consults Codex
  - More like "implementer has access to a test-review tool"
  - Human still in the loop, just empowered with better tools

  Your codex-review example is actually B, not A. It's a human working with Claude, and Claude can call Codex for help. But the human is still driving.

  My Honest Opinion

  For the test change request case specifically:

  I think the current workflow is correct but underspecified. The solution is NOT automation, but clarity:

  1. Implementer should document concern clearly (artifact-driven)
  2. Human reviews concern (human-as-manager)
  3. Human decides:
    - "Implement as-is" (test is correct)
    - "Re-review test" (invoke test-reviewer)
    - "Spec unclear" (escalate to spec-writer)
  4. Decision and outcome recorded (accountability)

  The problem isn't that this requires human involvement - that's a FEATURE. The problem is it's not specified clearly enough.

  For enabling role-to-role invocation in general:

  I'm skeptical but see the appeal. Here's why:

  Skeptical because:
  - Could become AI slop cascade (agents calling agents calling agents)
  - Loss of human visibility and control
  - Accountability becomes murky
  - Cost explosion potential
  - Debugging nightmare
  - Violates workflow's philosophical foundation

  See the appeal because:
  - Solo developers need efficiency
  - Some decisions are mechanical and don't need human judgment
  - Could enable more sophisticated agent behaviors
  - If bounded correctly, could reduce friction without losing control

  The Hybrid I'd Actually Recommend

  If you want to enable this, I'd suggest:

  1. Keep human-in-the-loop as default
  2. Allow roles to REQUEST cross-role invocations
  3. Human approves/modifies/rejects
  4. System executes approved invocation
  5. Results saved as artifacts

  This gives you:
  - Efficiency (agent formulates request, prepares context)
  - Control (human approves)
  - Auditability (all invocations recorded)
  - Flexibility (human can modify or reject)

  It's like pull requests: Agent proposes, human approves, system executes.

  Bottom Line

  Pure automation of role-to-role invocations feels wrong for this workflow. It undermines the careful structure you've built.

  But better tooling for human-mediated invocations feels right. Make it easy for humans to invoke roles with proper context, but keep humans in the loop.

  Unless you're willing to fundamentally rethink the "human-as-manager" principle and move toward more of an "agent swarm" model. That's valid, but it's a different
  philosophy entirely.

  What's your gut feeling? Are you looking to reduce friction while keeping humans central, or are you considering moving toward more autonomous agent-to-agent interaction?

> I don't think it needs to be as uncontrolled/unaccountable(?) as you are imagining. E.g. we could still have the communication be artifact driven. The the implementer can 
write a review request, "poke" or "wake" the other role's agent and that one can write an review artifact. It does make the human less central, but in a transparent, 
auditable way. And making the human less central is the point, to reduce the process load on the single human in the project. 

⏺ Ah, you're right - I was imagining it as more chaotic than it needs to be. If it's artifact-driven agent-to-agent communication, that changes everything.

  Reconsidering with Artifact-Driven Communication

  reviews/test-change-requests/
    2025-10-24T14-30-00-user-auth-REQUEST.md    (written by implementer)
    2025-10-24T14-45-00-user-auth-RESPONSE.md   (written by test-reviewer)

  This is actually very aligned with the workflow principles:

  ✓ Artifact-driven - All communication via filesystem✓ Auditable - Human can review anytime✓ Transparent - Clear record of who said what✓ Interruptible - Human can intervene
   at any point✓ Reversible - Can override agent decisions

  The only thing changing is: human delegates routine decisions instead of micromanaging every interaction.

  This Actually Makes Sense

  For a solo developer, the current workflow creates this problem:
  - Implementer finds test issue
  - Stop, write concern document
  - Context switch to human
  - Human reads, decides "yes this needs review"
  - Context switch to test-reviewer role
  - Test reviewer reads, analyzes, writes response
  - Context switch back to implementer
  - Implementer reads response, continues

  Three context switches for something that could be deterministic.

  With agent-to-agent artifact communication:
  - Implementer finds test issue
  - Writes request artifact
  - Pokes test-reviewer agent
  - Test-reviewer reads, analyzes, writes response artifact
  - Implementer reads response, continues
  - Human reviews audit trail later (or in real-time if desired)

  Zero forced context switches, full auditability.

  What Makes This Work

  The key is that artifacts provide the async boundary and audit trail:

  1. Request artifact - Clear structure, timestamped, attributed to implementer
  2. Response artifact - Clear structure, timestamped, attributed to test-reviewer
  3. Both in git - Version controlled, reviewable, permanent record

  Human can:
  - Watch in real-time (if desired)
  - Review later (async supervision)
  - Override decisions (edit artifacts, re-run)
  - See patterns (which interactions are common)
  - Tune the system (adjust when agents should/shouldn't interact)

  The Right Mental Model

  It's less like "agents autonomously managing each other" and more like "agents collaborating via structured documents while human supervises."

  This is actually very similar to how software teams work:
  - Developer opens PR
  - CI runs tests (automated)
  - Reviewer reviews (human or increasingly AI)
  - Results documented
  - Manager spot-checks, intervenes when needed

  My Revised Opinion: This Is Good, With Guardrails

  I think this is the right evolution of the workflow, with these guardrails:

  1. Structured Request/Response Formats

  Not free-form conversation, but typed interactions:
  # Test Change Request

  **Requestor:** implementer (Claude Sonnet 4.5)
  **Timestamp:** 2025-10-24T14:30:00
  **Feature:** specs/doing/user-auth.md
  **Tests:** tests/test_user_auth.py

  ## Test in Question
  test_register_duplicate_email_raises_error (line 45)

  ## Concern
  Test expects ValueError but spec says ValidationError

  ## Evidence
  Spec section 3.2: "Raises ValidationError if email invalid"

  ## Request
  Should test be changed to expect ValidationError?

  2. Invocation Limits

  Prevent runaway cascades:
  - Max depth: 2-3 levels
  - No circular invocations
  - Timeout/budget limits per invocation

  3. Human Override Points

  Define cases that MUST involve human:
  - Security-related changes
  - Architectural changes
  - Budget exceeded
  - Agents disagree (deadlock)

  4. Audit Trail Always Written

  Every invocation creates artifacts:
  - Request document
  - Response document
  - Invocation log (who called whom, when, outcome)

  5. Post-Session Review

  After a work session, human reviews:
  - What agent interactions occurred
  - What decisions were made
  - Are patterns emerging that need process changes

  Implementation Approach I'd Recommend

  Phase 1: Manual orchestration
  - Implementer writes request artifact
  - Human manually invokes test-reviewer with context
  - Test-reviewer writes response artifact
  - Validate the interaction pattern works

  Phase 2: Tool-assisted invocation
  - Implementer can call invoke_role() tool
  - Tool formats request artifact, invokes other agent, returns response
  - Human watches in real-time
  - Validate the automation works

  Phase 3: Autonomous with oversight
  - Agents can invoke each other directly
  - All interactions logged
  - Human reviews audit trail
  - Validate human can maintain oversight

  The Real Question

  Do you want human in-the-loop (approves each interaction) or on-the-loop (reviews interactions after they happen)?

  My sense is you want on-the-loop - let agents work, human supervises. That's reasonable for a solo developer trying to move fast.

  The artifact-driven approach makes "on-the-loop" safe because:
  - Everything is visible
  - Everything is reversible
  - Patterns emerge clearly
  - Human can tighten/loosen controls based on results

  I'm convinced. This is good design. What do you want to figure out next - the artifact formats, the "poke" mechanism, or the guardrails?
