# GTD: A Complete System

## Core Principles
- Complete state capture
- Clear next actions
- Trusted system
- Regular review
- Appropriate engagement

## State Components

### Core Lists (Required)
- Inbox (capture)
- Next Actions (by context)
- Projects
- Waiting For
- Someday/Maybe
- Calendar (hard landscape)

### State Classifications
Everything must be either:
- Project (requires multiple steps)
- Next Action (single step, actionable)
- Reference (no action required)
- Someday/Maybe (deferred decision)
- Trash (no longer relevant)

## State Transitions

### Capture
- Everything starts in Inbox
- No processing during capture
- Complete capture required
- No filtering during input
- Location doesn't matter (digital/paper)

### Processing (Inbox to Zero)
For each item, decide:
1. Actionable?
   - Yes -> Continue to 2
   - No -> Reference, Someday/Maybe, or Trash
2. Single step?
   - Yes -> Next Action (continue to 3)
   - No -> Project List + Next Action
3. Under 2 minutes?
   - Yes -> Do now
   - No -> Continue to 4
4. Specific person?
   - Yes -> Delegate & Waiting For
   - No -> Continue to 5
5. Specific time/date?
   - Yes -> Calendar
   - No -> Next Actions (by context)

### Project Planning
- Natural planning model
- Capture in project support
- Extract next actions
- Track in project list
- Review regularly

## System Components

### Required Components
1. Capture Tools
   - Always available
   - Friction-free
   - Multiple ok
   - Feed single inbox

2. Lists
   - Next Actions (by context)
   - Projects
   - Waiting For
   - Someday/Maybe
   - Reference filing
   - Calendar

3. Review Triggers
   - Weekly review checklist
   - Calendar review
   - Project list review
   - Higher horizons review

### Optional Components
- Project support material
- Reference filing systems
- Tickler file
- Checklists
- Goals/Objectives tracking

## Regular Reviews

### Daily
1. Calendar (hard landscape)
2. Next Actions review
3. New inputs to Inbox
4. Context-based choices

### Weekly
1. Clear all inboxes
2. Review previous calendar
3. Upcoming calendar
4. Empty head
5. Process notes
6. Review action lists
7. Review waiting for
8. Review projects
   - Status
   - New next actions
   - Stuck items
9. Review someday/maybe
10. Review higher horizons

### Higher Horizons (As Needed)
- Purpose/Principles
- Vision
- Goals
- Areas of Focus
- Projects

## Implementation Steps

### Initial Setup
1. Clear physical space
2. Gather all inputs
3. Process to zero
4. Set up lists
5. Calendar review
6. First weekly review

### First Two Weeks
1. Focus on capture
2. Build processing habit
3. Daily calendar review
4. Context lists usage

### First Month
1. Weekly review habit
2. Project list complete
3. Next actions clear
4. Reference system working

## State Management Practices

### Maintaining Next Actions
- One per project minimum
- Clear context
- Single next step
- Physically possible now
- No dependencies pending

### Project Tracking
- Clear outcome defined
- Next action identified
- Support material linked
- Regular review
- Forward progress

### Waiting For
- Clear who
- Clear what
- Clear when
- Regular review
- Follow-up trigger

### Calendar
- Hard landscape only
- Day-specific
- Time-specific
- No actions list

## System Maintenance

### Keep Track Of
1. Open loops
2. Stuck projects
3. Waiting items
4. Calendar commitments

### Watch For
1. Orphan next actions
2. Projects without next actions
3. Stale waiting items
4. Unclear outcomes

### Regular Check
1. Capture complete?
2. Processing clear?
3. Reviews happening?
4. System trusted?

## Key Differences from Bullet Journal
- Pre-defined list structure
- Context-based organization
- No rapid logging (capture only)
- Strict project/action distinction
- Processing separate from capture
- Fixed workflow for inputs

## Evolution Points

### Consider Adding
1. More granular contexts
2. Energy levels
3. Priority markers
4. Time estimates

### Consider Removing
1. Unused contexts
2. Complex sorting
3. Redundant tracking
4. Excess detail

## Troubleshooting

### Lost Trust
1. Mind sweep
2. Process to zero
3. Review all lists
4. Restore tracking

### System Overwhelm
1. Return to basics
2. Simplify contexts
3. Clear next actions
4. Weekly review

### Stuck Projects
1. Natural planning
2. Clear outcomes
3. Next action defined
4. Remove barriers

## Implementation Notes

1. Keep lists separate
2. Clear boundaries
3. Regular pruning
4. Easy access

### Project Support
1. Simple filing
2. Easy retrieval
3. Regular review
