# Bullet Journal: A Complete System

## Core Principles
- Complete state tracking
- Rapid capture
- Clear review surfaces
- Sustainable maintenance

## Basic Notation

### Core Bullets
- • Task (atomic, single-step)
- ⊙ Project (multi-step)
- ○ Event
- − Note

### Status Markers
- × Completed
- > Migrated
- < Scheduled
- ⌛ Waiting for (@person/thing)

### Signifiers (Optional)
- * Priority
- ! Important

## Required Collections

### 1. Daily Log
- Primary capture point
- Uses rapid logging
- All new items start here
- Review each morning:
  - Mark completed (×)
  - Migrate still-relevant (>)
  - Cross out obsolete
  - Schedule future (<)

### 2. Monthly Log
Two-page spread:
- Calendar (Left)
  - Dates down side
  - Events/deadlines
- Task List (Right)
  - Items from Future Log
  - Deferred but relevant tasks
  - Not for initial capture

### 3. Future Log
- Multi-month view
- Time-bound projects/events
- Known future commitments
- Feeds monthly setup

### 4. Projects Collection
- List of all active projects
- Single review point
- Core status tracking
- Reviewed monthly
- Projects can be:
  - Temporal (also in Future/Monthly)
  - Non-temporal (only here)

### 5. Index
- Collections list
- Page numbers
- Threading references

## State Transitions

### Capture
- Everything starts in Daily Log
- Use rapid logging
- No decisions during capture
- Mark type (•/⊙/○/−)
- Add waiting status (⌛) if applicable

### Morning Review
For each open item:
1. Complete? Mark ×
2. Still for today? Leave
3. Future dated? Move to Future Log (>)
4. This month but not today? Move to Monthly (>)
5. Project? Move to Projects Collection (>)
6. Obsolete? Strike through

### Monthly Migration
1. Review all collections
2. Migrate still-relevant items
3. Set up new month
4. Check Future Log
5. Update Projects list

## Optional Components

### Project Collections
- One per complex project
- Details and planning
- Dependencies
- Reference material
- Always referenced in Projects Collection

### Reference Collections
- Topic-based information
- Not action-dependent
- Indexed for findability
- Referenced when relevant

## Regular Reviews

### Daily (Morning)
1. Mark yesterday's status
2. Migrate as needed
3. Check Monthly calendar
4. Start new Daily Log

### Weekly (Optional)
1. Review open Daily Logs
2. Check Monthly for upcoming
3. Update waiting-for items

### Monthly
1. Set up new Monthly Log
2. Migrate open items
3. Check Future Log
4. Review Projects Collection
5. Update Index
6. Archive completed

## Implementation Steps

### Initial Setup
1. Number pages
2. Create Index (2 pages)
3. Set up Future Log (4-6 pages)
4. Create Monthly spread
5. Start Projects Collection
6. Begin first Daily Log

### First Two Weeks
1. Focus on rapid logging
2. Practice basic bullets
3. Daily migration only
4. Note emerging patterns

### First Month
1. Complete monthly migration
2. Establish review habit
3. Start needed collections
4. Refine signifier use

## Best Practices

### State Management
1. Rapid capture always
2. Clear status marking
3. Regular migration
4. Limited review surfaces

### Project Tracking
1. Mark clearly (⊙)
2. List in Projects Collection
3. Create collections as needed
4. Thread references

### Waiting Items
1. Mark with ⌛
2. Include @reference
3. Review during migration
4. Update status clearly

## System Maintenance

### Keep Track Of
1. Active projects
2. Waiting items
3. Future commitments

2. Unclear next actions
3. Stale waiting items
4. Missing reviews

### Regular Check
1. Review surfaces complete?
2. Migration paths clear?
3. Projects progressing?
4. System serving needs?

## Evolution Points

### Consider Adding
1. Context tags
2. Energy levels
3. Time estimates
4. Priority system

### Consider Removing
1. Unused signifiers
2. Stale collections
3. Complex tracking
4. Redundant marking

## Troubleshooting

### Lost Items
1. Check Daily Logs
2. Review Collections
3. Update Index
4. Restore tracking

### System Overwhelm
1. Return to basics
2. Reduce collections
3. Simplify tracking
4. Maintain reviews

### Stuck Projects
1. Check Projects Collection
2. Review dependencies
3. Identify next actions
4. Update tracking
