âœ… Complete GTD ontology (types and connections)
âœ… Core principles and philosophy
âœ… Essential query patterns with code
âœ… Coaching guidelines and techniques
âœ… Implementation guide with system prompt
âœ… Anti-patterns to avoid
âœ… Quick reference and navigation

## Specification Completeness

The current specification is **complete and usable** for:

1. **Building the system**
   - All architecture defined
   - All interfaces specified
   - Implementation guidance provided

2. **Understanding the approach**
   - Philosophy clearly articulated
   - Principles well-documented
   - Examples provided

3. **Deploying effectively**
   - System prompt template ready
   - Anti-patterns documented
   - Success criteria defined

## Using This Specification

### For Developers

**Start here:**
1. Read `memory_system_core.md` - understand the foundation
2. Read `file_storage_backend_interface.md` - implement or adapt backend
3. Read `gtd_assistant_core.md` - understand GTD layer
4. Implement using patterns from query/coaching docs

### For Implementers

**Start here:**
1. Read `gtd_overview.md` - get oriented
2. Read `gtd_interaction_principles.md` - understand approach
3. Read `gtd_implementation_guide.md` - use system prompt
4. Reference other docs as needed

### For Researchers

**Start here:**
1. Read `gtd_assistant_core.md` - philosophy and design rationale
2. Read `gtd_interaction_principles.md` - avoiding capability underutilization
3. Read `gtd_query_patterns.md` - composition over prescription
4. Consider extensions in implementation guide

## Modular Structure Benefits

The specification is split into focused modules because:

1. **Avoids size limits** - Each doc is manageable
2. **Supports different audiences** - Read what you need
3. **Enables updates** - Change one module without affecting others
4. **Facilitates understanding** - Focused topics, clear scope

2. Implement memory system core
3. Load GTD ontology
4. Use system prompt from implementation guide
5. Test with real scenarios
6. Iterate based on coaching guidelines

### For Extension

1. Define domain ontology (like GTD ontology)
2. Adapt query patterns for domain
3. Modify coaching guidelines for domain
4. Update system prompt
5. Test and refine
