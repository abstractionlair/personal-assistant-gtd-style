- **Reviewer:** [name]
- **Date:** [review date]
- **Review Type:** [ ] Quick (10-15 min) [ ] Standard (30-45 min) [ ] Deep (2-3 hours)

---

## Level 1: Structural Completeness

### Required Sections Present
- [ ] Vision statement (1-2 sentences)
- [ ] Problem statement (current state + desired future state)
- [ ] Target users (specific personas with behaviors)
- [ ] Value proposition and differentiation
- [ ] Product scope (in scope / future / never)
- [ ] Success criteria (metrics with timeline)
- [ ] Technical approach (stack + principles)
- [ ] Assumptions and constraints
- [ ] Open questions

### Section Adequacy
- [ ] Each section has >2 sentences (not just placeholders)
- [ ] No "[TODO]" or "TBD" markers
- [ ] Specific rather than generic
- [ ] Sufficient detail for decision-making

**Notes:**
[List any missing or inadequate sections]

## Level 2: Quality Assessment

### Vision Statement
- [ ] One sentence (maybe two if complex)
- [ ] Mentions target user, not just product
- [ ] Describes outcome/benefit, not features
- [ ] Emotionally resonant and memorable
- [ ] Solution-agnostic (allows pivots)
- [ ] Passes elevator test (easy to recall and repeat)

**Issues Found:**
[Note any quality issues]

**Suggested Improvement:**
[Provide concrete example if needed]

### Problem Statement
- [ ] Specific current state with concrete pain points
- [ ] Root causes identified, not just symptoms
- [ ] Clear desired future state (measurable improvement)
- [ ] Explains why problem persists today
- [ ] Evidence or validation that problem exists

**Issues Found:**
[Note any quality issues]

**Suggested Improvement:**
[Provide concrete example if needed]

### Target Users
- [ ] Specific personas with names/roles
- [ ] Demographics AND behavioral attributes
- [ ] Current behavior and alternatives described
- [ ] Jobs-to-be-done articulated
- [ ] Specific enough to determine who's excluded

**Issues Found:**
[Note any quality issues]

**Suggested Improvement:**
[Provide concrete example if needed]

### Value Proposition & Differentiation
- [ ] Primary benefit focused on outcomes
- [ ] Emotional + practical dimensions
- [ ] Clear statement of what's unique
- [ ] Explains why users will choose this
- [ ] Addresses real competitive alternatives

**Issues Found:**
[Note any quality issues]

**Suggested Improvement:**
[Provide concrete example if needed]

### Scope
- [ ] MVP scope achievable in stated timeline
- [ ] Clear boundaries (in/future/never)
- [ ] "Never in scope" prevents scope creep
- [ ] Features at right level (capabilities not buttons)
- [ ] Aligned with stated success criteria

**Issues Found:**
[Note any quality issues]

**Suggested Improvement:**
[Provide concrete example if needed]

### Success Criteria
- [ ] 3-5 specific, measurable metrics
- [ ] Metrics measure value delivered, not vanity
- [ ] Counter-metrics as guardrails included
- [ ] Timeline milestones (6mo/1yr/3yr)
- [ ] Metrics aligned with problem statement

**Issues Found:**
[Note any quality issues]

**Suggested Improvement:**
[Provide concrete example if needed]

### Assumptions & Constraints
- [ ] Market assumptions explicitly stated
- [ ] Technical feasibility assumptions noted
- [ ] Resource constraints documented
- [ ] Riskiest assumptions identified
- [ ] Validation plan for key assumptions

**Issues Found:**
[Note any quality issues]

**Suggested Improvement:**
[Provide concrete example if needed]

## Level 3: Anti-Pattern Detection

### Check Each Pattern
- [ ] **Feature List Syndrome** - Vision describes capabilities rather than outcomes
- [ ] **Mission Confusion** - Too broad and timeless (company mission, not product vision)
- [ ] **Solution Lock-In** - Commits to specific technology/platform
- [ ] **Vague Aspirations** - Buzzwords without concrete meaning
- [ ] **Competitor Obsession** - Defined by beating competitors vs. serving customers
- [ ] **Scope Creep Spiral** - Expanding continuously without boundaries
- [ ] **Premature Abandonment Setup** - Timeline too short (< 2 years)
- [ ] **Metric Mirage** - Vanity metrics that don't measure real value
- [ ] **Technical Architecture as Vision** - Describes implementation not outcomes
- [ ] **Solo Developer Sustainability Trap** - Unrealistic scope for resources

**Anti-Patterns Detected:**
[List any patterns found with specific evidence]

**Fix Recommendations:**
[For each pattern, provide concrete fix with example]

- [ ] Vision statement passes quality tests
- [ ] Problem is specific and validated
- [ ] Target users are concrete
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
