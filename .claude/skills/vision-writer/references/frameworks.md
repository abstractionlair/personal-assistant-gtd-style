# Vision Frameworks Reference

This document provides detailed guidance on proven frameworks for creating product visions.

## Geoffrey Moore's Elevator Pitch

From "Crossing the Chasm" (1991), this remains the most widely-used framework.

### Template

```
For [target customers]
who [statement of need],
the [product name]
is a [product category]
that [key benefit].
Unlike [primary competitive alternative],
our product [statement of primary differentiation].
```

### Completion Guidelines

**For [target customers]:**
- Be specific enough to make decisions
- Demographics + behavioral attributes
- Example: "For enterprise product managers" not just "for professionals"

**who [statement of need]:**
- Focus on root causes, not symptoms
- Use jobs-to-be-done framing
- Example: "who struggle to align stakeholders around shared product roadmap"

**the [product name]:**
- Use working name if final name unknown
- Can be descriptive: "TaskFlow Context Manager"

**is a [product category]:**
- Choose recognizable category
- Sets expectations for evaluation
- Example: "project management tool" or "developer workflow assistant"

**that [key benefit]:**
- Focus on primary outcome
- Avoid feature lists
- Example: "eliminates context loss when switching between projects"

**Unlike [primary competitive alternative]:**
- Name the real alternative (including "do nothing")
- Understand what users use today
- Example: "Unlike Jira and Notion"

**our product [statement of primary differentiation]:**
- Explain the unique approach
- Why users will choose this
- Example: "maintains living context that evolves with code rather than requiring separate documentation"

### Strengths

- Forces clarity and conciseness
- Prevents common pitfalls (jargon, feature lists, competitor obsession)
- Completes in 20-60 minutes
- Works as thinking tool, not final prose

### Weaknesses

- Can feel formulaic when recited verbatim
- May not capture emotional dimension
- Limited space for complexity

### When to Use

- Initial vision drafting
- When team needs alignment quickly
- External communication (fundraising, recruiting)
- As constraint to force conciseness

## Roman Pichler's Product Vision Board

Visual framework capturing strategy across five dimensions.

### Board Structure

```
                    VISION
              [1-2 sentences at top]

TARGET GROUP    |    NEEDS    |    PRODUCT
[Who uses it]   | [Problems]  | [Key features]
                |             |
BUSINESS GOALS  |             |
[Why build it]  |             |
```

### Section Guidelines

**Vision (center top):**
- 1-2 sentence statement
- Most prominent position
- Everything else supports this

**Target Group:**
- 2-4 specific personas
- Include demographics + behaviors
- Use images/names to make concrete

**Needs:**
- Top 3-5 pain points
- Root causes, not symptoms
- Validated through research

**Product:**
- 3-5 standout features
- High-level capabilities only
- What differentiates this product

**Business Goals:**
- Why company is building this
- Revenue, market entry, brand, learning
- Connects product to organization strategy

### Strengths

- Visual format aids communication
- Facilitates collaborative workshops
- Single artifact for team reference
- Captures more dimensions than elevator pitch

### Weaknesses

- Requires collaborative session to create
- Can become too detailed
- Visual format less suited for remote teams

### When to Use

- Team/stakeholder alignment workshops
- When visual communication preferred
- Quarterly strategic reviews
- Living document on team wall

### Validation Approach

Pichler emphasizes: "No major hypotheses should remain untested before deriving product backlog."

**Validation progression:**
1. Problem validation: Confirm users experience stated needs
2. Solution validation: Test that product approach addresses needs
3. Usability validation: Verify product is easy to use
4. Business validation: Confirm business model viability

## Amazon's PR/FAQ (Working Backwards)

Start with the customer by writing press release as if product already launched.

### PR Section

**Components (under 1 page):**

1. **Headline:** Attention-grabbing summary of benefit
2. **Subheading:** Who it's for and what benefit they get
3. **Summary paragraph:** How it works at high level
4. **Problem statement:** What pain this solves
5. **Solution description:** How product addresses problem
6. **Executive quote:** Why we built this, strategic context
7. **Customer testimonial:** How customer's life improved

### FAQ Section

**Customer-facing questions:**
- How does this work?
- How much does it cost?
- When is it available?
- How is this different from alternatives?

**Internal questions:**
- Is this technically feasible?
- What are the resource requirements?
- What are the risks?
- What are key success metrics?

### Creation Process

Amazon teams commonly iterate through **10+ drafts**, spending weeks refining.

**Refinement tests:**
- "So what?" test: Is this meaningfully better/faster/cheaper?
- Customer excitement: Would customers actually use this?
- Clarity: Can everyone understand without technical jargon?

### Strengths

- Prevents building things customers don't want
- Forces customer-centric thinking
- Validates value proposition early
- Useful for customer research (show mock press release, gauge reaction)

### Weaknesses

- Time-intensive to create well
- Requires strong writing skills
- May feel artificial initially
- Less structured than other frameworks

### When to Use

- New product initiatives
- When customer benefit unclear
- Before major engineering investment
- Internal proposal for new direction

## Lean Canvas

One-page business model adapted from Business Model Canvas, optimized for startups.

### Canvas Structure (9 blocks)

```
+------------------+------------------+------------------+
|    PROBLEM       | SOLUTION         | UNIQUE VALUE     |
|  (top 3 issues)  | (top 3 features) |   PROPOSITION    |
|                  |                  |   (high-level)   |
+------------------+------------------+------------------+
|                  | UNFAIR           | CHANNELS         |
|  KEY METRICS     | ADVANTAGE        | (path to         |
|  (key numbers)   | (can't be        |  customers)      |
|                  |  copied/bought)  |                  |
+------------------+------------------+------------------+
|     COST STRUCTURE               | REVENUE STREAMS    |
|     (customer acquisition,       | (revenue model)    |
|      hosting, etc.)              |                    |
+----------------------------------+--------------------+
```

### Completion Order

Ash Maurya recommends this sequence:

1. **Problem:** Start here. Top 3 pain points.
2. **Customer Segments:** Who has these problems?
3. **Unique Value Proposition:** Single, clear, compelling message
4. **Solution:** Top 3 features addressing top 3 problems
5. **Channels:** How will you reach customers?
6. **Revenue Streams:** How will you make money?
7. **Cost Structure:** What are the costs?
8. **Key Metrics:** What numbers matter?
9. **Unfair Advantage:** What can't be easily copied?

### Key Principle

"Most startups fail not because they fail to build what they set out to build, but because they waste time, money, and effort building the wrong product." - Ash Maurya

**Problem has most prominent position** to emphasize problem understanding over solution infatuation.

### Strengths

- Forces business model clarity
- Completes in 20 minutes (initial draft)
- Iterates quickly as you learn
- Connects product to business viability
- One-page format enables rapid sharing

### Weaknesses

- More business model than pure vision
- May not capture emotional/inspirational elements
- Simplified view of complex markets

### When to Use

- Early-stage startups
- When business model uncertain
- Rapid iteration and experimentation
- Internal alignment on business fundamentals

### Iteration Approach

1. Create initial canvas in 20 minutes
2. Identify riskiest assumptions
3. Design experiments to test assumptions
4. Update canvas based on learnings
5. Repeat weekly/monthly as you learn

## Combining Frameworks

Many teams use multiple frameworks in sequence:

**Common progression:**
1. **Lean Canvas** for initial business model exploration
2. **Geoffrey Moore** for concise vision statement
3. **Vision Board** for team alignment workshop
4. **PR/FAQ** before major feature development

**Example workflow:**
- Week 1: Lean Canvas to explore business model
- Week 2: Customer interviews to validate problem
- Week 3: Geoffrey Moore pitch for concise vision
- Week 4: Vision Board workshop for team alignment
- Ongoing: Update canvas/board as you learn

## Common Across All Frameworks

Regardless of framework, effective visions share:

1. **Customer focus**: Describes user outcomes, not product features
2. **Problem clarity**: Root causes, not symptoms
3. **Measurable impact**: Specific success criteria
4. **Differentiation**: Clear unique value vs. alternatives
5. **Feasibility**: Ambitious but achievable
6. **Stability**: Valid for 2-5 years despite tactical pivots

The framework is a thinking tool, not the final output. Use what helps clarify thinking, then communicate in whatever format resonates best with your audience.
